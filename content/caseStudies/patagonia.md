    title: Marketing as “Don’t Buy Our Product”?!
    content: "Where most brands use marketing to convert prospects into customers,
      [Patagonia ](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/home/)wants to turn customers
      into activists. Patagonia is famous for having run full-page ads reading,
      “Don’t buy this jacket.” The ads were part of its “Common Threads
      Partnership.” Patagonia reckons that many of us in the developed world
      have enough clothes in our closets to keep us warm for a lifetime. And yet
      we keep buying new clothes, which are environmentally harmful to produce
      and will end up in a landfill. The Common Threads Partnership takes a
      serious stab at reducing (making clothes that last longer), repairing
      (Patagonia repairs clothes for its customers), reusing (the company
      resells your used clothes on eBay or in their stores’ Worn Wear section),
      and recycling (you can return your old clothes to Patagonia and they
      recycle them). Will this initiative harm Patagonia’s growth in the short
      term? Yes. Every repaired and every reused jacket is one less jacket
      bought. Will it increase its growth in the long term, through higher
      customer loyalty? Perhaps. But Patagonia’s decision wasn’t driven by
      forecasts and financials. The company chose the path its purpose called
      for. For more on Patagonia’s marketing approach see, [The Purpose-Driven
      Marketer: How Patagonia Uses Storytelling To Turn Consumers Into
