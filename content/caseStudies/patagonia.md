    title: Marketing as “Don’t Buy Our Product”?!
    content: "Where most brands use marketing to convert prospects into customers,
      [Patagonia ](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/home/)wants to turn customers
      into activists. Patagonia is famous for having run full-page ads reading,
      “Don’t buy this jacket.” The ads were part of its “Common Threads
      Partnership.” Patagonia reckons that many of us in the developed world
      have enough clothes in our closets to keep us warm for a lifetime. And yet
      we keep buying new clothes, which are environmentally harmful to produce
      and will end up in a landfill. The Common Threads Partnership takes a
      serious stab at reducing (making clothes that last longer), repairing
      (Patagonia repairs clothes for its customers), reusing (the company
      resells your used clothes on eBay or in their stores’ Worn Wear section),
      and recycling (you can return your old clothes to Patagonia and they
      recycle them). Will this initiative harm Patagonia’s growth in the short
      term? Yes. Every repaired and every reused jacket is one less jacket
      bought. Will it increase its growth in the long term, through higher
      customer loyalty? Perhaps. But Patagonia’s decision wasn’t driven by
      forecasts and financials. The company chose the path its purpose called
      for. For more on Patagonia’s marketing approach see, [The Purpose-Driven
      Marketer: How Patagonia Uses Storytelling To Turn Consumers Into

  - topic: Information Flow
    title: Extend information flow throughout the market, incorporating suppliers
      and customers
    content: "[Patagonia](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/home/) has gone beyond the
      boundaries of the organization with its \"Footprint Chronicles\".
      Information transparency has been extended to suppliers and customers.
      Customers can see where everthing is made, how it is made, what the
      conditions are like, what the impact of transportation and water usage is
      on the overall carbon footprint. A major part of the organization's
      purpose is served by employing this radical degree of honesty with regard
      to information and information flow when dealing with outside parties.
      Information exchange with suppliers and customers via email and internet
      is used to fuel continous improvement."
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Hiring is a relatively slow process, performed by peers over multiple
      interviews.
    content: >-
      Yvon Chouinard founded what would later be called
      [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/) in 1957 to produce climbing pitons.
      The California-based company has grown into a leading outdoor apparel
      maker, committed to being a positive influence on the environment.


      In Patagonia hire is made slowly with interview from peers, as much as possible from withiɳ.
  - topic: Environmental and Social Management
    content: "Patagonia embraced reduction of their environmental foot-print ― even
      at the risk of negative impact to the bottom line. Yvon Chouinard,
      Patagonia’s founder, gives this example:\r

      \r

      \"In the mid-nineties, we decided to change the packaging of our
      thermal underwear. We were using a thick, wraparound cardboard header
      inside a heavy Ziploc plastic bag... For the heavier-weight expedition
      underwear, we decided to go without any packaging at all and hang them up
      like regular clothing... For the underwear made of lighter-weight
      material, we just rolled them up and put a rubber band around them. We
      were warned to be prepared for a 30 percent cut in sales... we were
      competing with companies...extremely competitive with their packaging...
      We did it anyway because it was the right thing to do. The first year this
      practice kept twelve tons of material from being shipped around the
      world... and being dumped into landfills... it saved the company $150,000
      in unnecessary packaging... (and) brought us a 25 percent increase in
      thermal underwear sales. Since they weren’t hidden away in a package and
      had to be displayed like the regular clothing, people could feel the
      material and appreciate the quality. And since they were displayed like
      the other clothes, we were forced to make our underwear look like regular
      clothing, to the point that now most Capilene underwear tops can be worn
      as a regular shirt, fulfilling our goal of making clothes that are
      multifunctional.\"\r

      \r

      Most strikingly, Patagonia resolved in the summer of 1994 to replace
      all conventionally grown cotton with organic cotton... The raw material
      cost three times more, and the cotton product line was reduced from 91
      styles to 66. It was a big risk. And yet Patagonia felt there was no
      alternative... cotton fields that covered only three percent of the
      world’s farmland were responsible for 10 percent of the worldwide use of
      pesticide and 25 percent of the use of insecticides. Against all
      expectations, Patagonia’s organic cotton program turned out to be
      financially beneficial. More importantly, it has convinced others in the
      industry to follow suit.\r

      \r

      When the company moved its warehouse from California to Nevada, many
      colleagues moved too. Some realized that Nevada has lots of wild country
      and federal land, but very little of it was protected as wilderness. Four
      employees took the initiative. They got support from company leaders in
      the form of salries and facilities. They built a broad coalition, went to
      Washington, and lobbied. As a result, 1.2 million acres of wilderness were
      protected"
    title: Environmental and social initiatives can start anywhere in the
      organization. To their surprise, they have found alignment to values may
      not undermine financial performance―indeed, quite the contrary.
