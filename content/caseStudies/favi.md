    title: Sending love to clients
    content: "Through a process of collective discussion, FAVI’s employees
      determined the organization had two reasons for existence, two fundamental
      purposes: the first to provide meaningful work in the area of Hallencourt,
      a rural area in northern France where good work is rare; the second to
      give and receive love from clients. Yes, love, a word rarely heard in the
      world of business, and even more unexpected in a blue-collar manufacturing
      environment. At FAVI, it has taken on real meaning. Operators don’t just
      send products to their clients, they send products into which they have
      put their heart. A few years ago, around Christmas time, an operator at
      FAVI molded excess brass into a few small figurines of Santa and of
      reindeers. He added the figurines into the boxes of finished products,
      rather like kids put a message in a bottle they throw out to sea,
      imagining that someone, somewhere, would find it. Other operators have
      since picked up on the idea and at random times of the year add brass
      figurines into their shipments, as little tokens of love to their
      counterparts working on assembly lines at Volkswagen or Volvo, who will
      find the figurines when they unpack the boxes.^\\[Laloux, Frederic
