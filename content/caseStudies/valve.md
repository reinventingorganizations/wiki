    title: Valve uses a stack ranking system to determine compensation.
    content: >-
      [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/) is a leading video game developer
      and distributor. Once a year, a designated group of employees (the group
      changes every year) interviews everyone in the company, asking for
      feedback on each individual that person has worked with over the past year
      (this information is used primarily for constructive feedback) and asking
      the employee to rank each member of his own project/product group on the
      following four metrics:


      * Skill level/Technical Ability

      * Productivity/Output

      * Group Contribution

      * Product Contribution


      Each of these metrics is given equal weight in compiling a stack ranking of all the employees in a given group. Once the intra-group ranking is done, the information gets pooled for the company as a whole and is used to determine compensation. The system is based on a belief that these four metrics are the most appropriate for determining the "correct" compensation and that they in turn are best determined through a peer-based valuation process (which the company believes is less likely to be subject to bias given its flat organizational structure).
