    title: Heiligenfeld have weekly, large group reflective meetings.
    content: >-
      **Large group reflective meetings:**


      Every Tuesday morning 350 employees come together to engage in joint reflection. (Some colleagues need to stay with patients.)


      Every week a new, relevant topic is put on the agenda. Topics have included: conflict resolution, dealing with failure, [values](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/culture-and-values), and similar.


      The meeting kicks off with a presentation to frame the subject matter.


      The heart of the meeting is when small groups engage in self-reflection. As for instance, the topic ‘dealing with failure’: A short presentation introduces ways to deal gracefully with failure – how new possibilities open up when we stop being judgmental about our failures, etc.


      Then people shuffle chairs around to create groups of 6 to 10 people. They reflect on the topic, guided by a facilitator they elect.  


      At some point, a microphone goes around the room and people can share what came up in the discussion.


      There is no scripted outcome to these meetings: no expected end product. As well as personal learning, collective insights emerge. Initiatives are then carried out when people go back to work.


      It’s a time-consuming practice, but people at [Heiligenfeld](http://www.heiligenfeld.de/) say the benefits far outweigh the costs. These meetings are like a company-wide training program on steroids.  


      The common experience also fosters community and a common language. To approving chuckles in the room, an employee of Heiligenfeld once stood up at the end of one such meeting and said ‘ You know, I wish I could have more Heiligenfeld at home.

      **Example for Reflective Practice**


      At Heiligenfeld, every Tuesday morning, 350 employees come together for an hour and a quarter to engage in joint reflection. Every week, a new topic that is relevant at the moment and conducive to self-reflection is put on the agenda. Recent meetings have reflected on subjects as diverse as conflict resolution, dealing with failure, company values, interpersonal communication, bureaucracy, IT innovations, risk management, personal health, and mindfulness. The meeting always kicks off with a short presentation to frame the subject matter, followed by self-reflection in small groups. Every group elects a facilitator who enforces a few ground rules to create a space where it’s safe to explore, to be authentic and vulnerable. In the confines of the small group, helped by their colleagues’ listening, people dare to dig deep and gain new insights about themselves and others. Colleagues are exposed every week to a space made safe by ground rules that invites them to truly be themselves. They learn to see each other in the light of their deep humanity, in the beauty of their strengths and vulnerability. The trust, empathy, and compassion that build up in the meeting expand well beyond the confines of the meeting room. These feelings start to permeate the whole organization.

      **Example for Team supervision**


      Heiligenfeld has developed a simple practice of team supervision. The company works with four external coaches who each have their domain of expertise (relationships, organizational development, system thinking, leadership). There are a number of time slots with the coaches every month that teams can sign up for. The recommendation is for every team to hold at least one session a year; on average teams hold two to four. In the discussion, with the help of the outside supervisor, colleagues can explore what a tension reveals about themselves and how they can grow to resolve it.

    content: At Heiligenfeld every Tuesday morning, all 350 employees come together
      for an hour and a quarter to engage in joint reflection. Every week, a new
      topic that is current and conducive to self-reflection is put on the
      agenda. Recent meetings have reflected on subjects as diverse as conflict
      resolution, dealing with failure, company values, interpersonal
      communication, bureaucracy, IT innovations, risk management, personal

  - topic: Strategy
    title: Strategy is developed through sensing rather than forecasting.
    content: "Heiligenfeld uses large group meetings at regular intervals to sense
      into its future. From one such session, the vision emerged of bringing
      Heiligenfeld’s holistic approach to mental illness to families with
      children and adolescents. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if patients could be
      treated together with their close family members, in a way that would
      specifically address and honor the family ties in the therapy? A year
      later, they opened, a new mental health hospital specifically dedicated to
      therapy for families.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing

  - topic: wholeness
    title: Company-wide reflection
    content: "Among the great number of innovative management practices Heiligenfeld
      has introduced over the years, employees often credit one practice in
      particular for making the company an outstanding workplace. Every Tuesday
      morning, 350 or so employees come together for an hour and a quarter to
      engage in joint reflection (as many as don’t need to be with patients and
      as the size of the room will allow). Each week, a new topic that is
      relevant at the moment and conducive to self-reflection is put on the
      agenda - subjects as diverse as conflict resolution, dealing with failure,
      company values, interpersonal communication, bureaucracy, IT innovations,
      risk management, personal health, and mindfulness.\r

      \r

      The meeting always kicks off with a short presentation to frame the
      subject matter. But the heart of the meeting happens in small groups
      engaged in self-reflection. Let’s take the example of the topic “dealing
      with failure” to illustrate how this event plays out at Heiligenfeld. The
      short plenary presentation introduces ways to deal gracefully with
      failure— how new possibilities open up when we stop being judgmental about
      our failures; how from a higher place of consciousness we can view failure
      as life’s invitation to expand our skills and awareness and grow into more
      of who we are.\r

      \r

      After this short introduction, people shuffle their chairs around to
      create groups of six to ten people. In the groups, people are asked to
      reflect on the topic— how they deal with failure in their lives, at work
      and at home, individually and collectively. Every group elects a
      facilitator who enforces a few ground rules to create a space where it’s
      safe to explore, to be authentic and vulnerable. In the confines of the
      small group, helped by their colleagues’ listening, people dare to dig
      deep and gain new insights about themselves and others. At some point, a
      microphone goes around the room and people who feel inclined to do so
      share what came up for them in the discussion. There is no scripted
      outcome to these meetings, no expected end product; everyone comes out of
      the meeting with his or her own personal learning. Often, collective
      insights emerge, as well as decisions and initiatives that are then
      carried out when people go back to work.\r

      \r

      It’s a time-consuming practice for sure - 75 minutes every week for
      more than half of the company. But people at Heiligenfeld say the benefits
      far outweigh the costs. These large group meetings are like a company-wide
      training program on steroids; the whole organization grows its way through
      one topic after another, week after week.[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).
