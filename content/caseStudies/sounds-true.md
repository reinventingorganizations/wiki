      practices have helped her develop her intuitive capacities, which she
      believes serves her well in her business:\r

      \r

      “Intuition is basically my entire existence,” Tami states. She
      studies with a meditation teacher named Reggie Ray. Reggie’s teacher
      taught him how to “read the signs” and Reggie passed these teachings on to
      Tami. “It’s an art form and an indigenous survival skill. If you were on a
      hunt, you would watch for the tracks. That’s how we pick projects. We read
      the signs. How many people are talking about it? How many requests do we
      get for a particular author? And what are our inner feelings about the
      project? That’s very important, too.” The company “reads the signs” for
      internal issues as well. … One exercise that Tami finds useful for tapping
      into inspiration is a visualization exercise. She describes the process:
      “You visualize yourself going into the center of the Earth to tap into
      fresh waters and bring them to the surface. It’s weird; totally new ideas
      just emerge. The visualization calms down the chatty mind and creates the
      space for vision to come forward.”^[ Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  - topic: Mood Management
    title: At Sounds True members of the organization came up with two ideas for
      Wholeness Events. These promote a mood of fun, trust, wholeness and
      excitement. The events called “Art Salon” and “Pajama Day”. They have
      become annual events.
    content: "Five years ago, a colleague at Sounds True took it upon herself to
      organize an “Art Salon” on a Friday afternoon. Everyone was invited to
      share an artistic passion with his or her colleagues. Walls throughout the
      office were filled with photographs and paintings.\r

      \r

      A small stage was erected for performance. Some chose to sing (some
      songs about life in the company were particular hits), others juggled or
      danced. It was so popular that the salon became an annual event. Tami
      Simon, the company founder, wasn’t involved in setting up the first salon,
      but she sees that it has become an important element in the company
      culture: \"I realized these events are saying to people, “You get to be a
      whole person. This part of you, it may not fit to do it as part of your
      job every day. … But the fact that you can now juggle five balls is
      actually cool. And one Friday afternoon, we want to sit back and have a
      glass of wine and watch you do this and acknowledge this part of you.”\r

      \r

      For reasons by now half-forgotten, someone suggested \"Pajama Day\"
      as a celebration of the arrival of spring.  Everyone who wanted to join
      would share breakfast at the office … in pajamas. The handful that showed
      up had so much fun during breakfast that they decided to keep their
      pajamas on at work the rest of the day.\r

      \r

      Since then, the event has taken place every year. Now 90 percent of
      the employees show up in pajamas, and a prize is given for the best
      outfit. (A matching set of pajamas for master and dog shared the prize
      once.)\r

      \r

      It has become an event people look forward to and prepare for. In
      its own quirky way, “Pajama Day” is a storytelling event―every pair of
      pajamas represents a story waiting to say something about the person
      wearing them: What made you choose that outfit?\r

      \r

      Wearing a professional mask at work is decidedly more difficult when
      everyone strolls around in funny sleepwear."

      One of the things I’ve found out at [Sounds
      True](https://www.soundstrue.com/) is in the first three months of
      employment a lot of the people don’t stay. … Sounds True, people want to
      get to know who you are, they want you to be real, they don’t want you to
      wear forty masks to work. It’s like―will the real person please stand up?
      There is this sense of authenticity; who we are when we are not at work is
      who we are when we are at work. That’s the kind of environment that’s here
      and of course we try to screen for this and let people know before they
      take the job, and a lot of people go “Oh I’m totally ready for that.  I’m
      interested in that, that’s what I want.”  But then they come in and may or
      may not be comfortable actually working in that kind of environment where
      people when they stop in the hallway and ask “How are you doing?” actually
      mean it! "How 'are' you doing?".

    title: "Sounds True has a three step appraisal process that turns an appraisal
      discussion into an experience of genuine inquiry and celebration. "
    content: >-
      [Sounds True](https://www.soundstrue.com/) has a three step appraisal
      process:


      * In phase 1, employees reflect on their performance and aspirations based on a list of questions to trigger thinking.

      * In phase 2, the practice starts with a minute of silence where colleagues are asked to hold the person receiving feedback in their hearts and try to let go of any form of judgement. Then, in turn, each person sits in front of their colleague and talks openly about what they most value in their colleague and reflect on one area where they think they could grow.

      * Finally in phase 3, the employee and a colleague reflect on the feedback through a deeper conversation to learn and decide what happens next.


      Feedback about how individuals can improve is given in the natural course of events throughout the year and not saved up for the annual appraisal.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 183]

    title: An example of outside investors compatible with Teal
    content: "Through careful selection of investors, Tami Simon has been able to
      bring in outside equity capital without sacrificing the company’s
      commitment to Teal practices and to multiple bottom lines. These investors
      are considered to be one of its key stakeholders: “We are committed to
      growing the long-term value of the business through careful planning and

      In the early days, Tami Simon, the founder and CEO of
      <http://www.soundstrue.com> Sounds True, brought her dog along to the
      office. When the business expanded and employees were hired, it didn’t
      take long for some of them to ask if they too could bring their dogs to
      work. Tami couldn’t think of a reason to refuse. Today it is not rare for
      a meeting to take place with two or three dogs lying at people’s feet.
      Something special happens within the presence of dogs, colleagues noticed.
      Animals tend to ground us, to bring out the better sides of our nature.
      The simple practice of petting a dog tends to soothe us, to reconnect us
      to our body, and to calm down our spinning minds. And when it’s a
      colleague’s dog we pet, or a colleague that pets ours, we subtly build
      community. People found that the decision to open the company’s doors
      didn’t only allow in dogs, but more human life as well.^\[Laloux, Frederic

Because we do welcome it, we want to see it.*^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  - topic: Evolutionary Purpose
    content: >-
      For Tami Simon, founder of Sounds True, purpose came before business:


      > *I’m kind of a strange person in a certain way. I dropped out of college because I didn’t feel like I actually could be myself in an academic environment. … I felt that in the academic environment I was being asked to pose as somebody who had answers to questions when instead I had experiences that I wanted to explore more deeply. … I went into a deep internal process where I prayed extremely hard and the prayer had to do with being of service. … The way I was thinking as a 20-, 21-year-old college dropout was, “Could I please be given the opportunity to take the talents that I have and all the gifts that I have been given by a very supporting and loving family and terrific opportunities for higher education … and give back in some way?” … The prayer was, “God, I’m willing to do your work. Please show me what it is. Please just show me what it is.”*

      >

      > *This phrase “willing to do your work” was very important to me because I didn’t want to be willful. I didn’t want to insist that it had to go my way. At the same time I didn’t want to be will-less where I was simply waiting in a coffee shop to be discovered. …*

      >

      > *I feel like Sounds True, this business, came to me as a 21-, 22-year-old as a gift and as a kind of covenant with the universe, a kind of bond where I said, “I’ll serve you. I’ll work really hard,” and the other side of it was, “You’ll be supported, you’ll be shown, doors will open, you’ll meet the people, opportunities will happen.” It’s this sense of a cosmic agreement that … I could help distribute spiritual teachings from different wisdom traditions from around the world. And I could do it with sincerity and devotion. That was my outlook from the beginning. It was never really about me per se. I wanted to be myself, I wanted to be authentic, and I wanted to make a contribution.^\[Tami Simon, interviewed by Diederick Janse and Ewan Townhead, podcast series “Waking up the Workplace,” episode “Even Sages need a Business Plan,” April 14, 2011.]*
