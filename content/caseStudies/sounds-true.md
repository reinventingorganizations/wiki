      “Intuition is basically my entire existence,” Tami states. She
      studies with a meditation teacher named Reggie Ray. Reggie’s teacher
      taught him how to “read the signs” and Reggie passed these teachings on to
      Tami. “It’s an art form and an indigenous survival skill. If you were on a
      hunt, you would watch for the tracks. That’s how we pick projects. We read
      the signs. How many people are talking about it? How many requests do we
      get for a particular author? And what are our inner feelings about the
      project? That’s very important, too.” The company “reads the signs” for
      internal issues as well. … One exercise that Tami finds useful for tapping
      into inspiration is a visualization exercise. She describes the process:
      “You visualize yourself going into the center of the Earth to tap into
      fresh waters and bring them to the surface. It’s weird; totally new ideas
      just emerge. The visualization calms down the chatty mind and creates the
      space for vision to come forward.”^[ Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).
