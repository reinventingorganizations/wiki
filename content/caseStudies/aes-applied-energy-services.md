    title: AES uses the practice of a survey to stimulate discussions about values
      and ground rules.
    content: "Annual survey: Many organizations cultivate discussion about values
      and ground rules through an annual survey. At [AES](http://www.aes.com/),
      for instance, a task force of volunteers devised a new set of questions
      every year and sent them out to the entire organization. Each unit had the
      obligation— it was one of the ground rules— to discuss the outcome of the
      survey, in whatever format it thought would be useful."
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: At AES, candidates are invited to discussions about the organization’s
      values and practices during the recruitment process.
    content: 'An employee of [AES](https://www.ase.com/Home.aspx) explained: "bad
      hire" is someone who is a chronic complainer, who is not happy, who blames
      others, who doesn’t take responsibility, who’s not honest, who doesn’t
      trust other people. A bad hire would be someone who needs specific
      direction and waits to be told what to do. A poor hire would be someone
      who wasn’t flexible and who says, “It’s not my job.”'
  - topic: Environmental and Social Management
    title: "Via the advice process, AES employees initiate environmental and social
      initiatives. "
    content: "For AES, environmental and social initiatives start with inner
      rightness. Here is how AES expressed it in a public filing with the U.S.
      Securities and Exchange Commission when it offered stock to the public:
      \"An important element of AES is its commitment to four major 'shared'
      values ^[one of which is Social Responsibility, which triggered AES’s
      decision to plant trees]. If the company perceives a conflict between
      these values and profits, it will try to adhere to its values ― even if
      doing so might result in diminished profits or foregone opportunities.
      Moreover, the Company seeks to adhere to these values not as a means to
      achieve economic success, but because adherence is a worthwhile goal in
      and of itself.\"\r

      \r

      AES planted millions of trees to offset carbon emissions. This idea
      came from an employee in in Los Angeles, not the senior team. Initially
      there was no budget for this. Using the advice process, she built support
      for the money AES should put into tree planting. ^[Source: Laloux,

  - topic: Strategy
    title: Strategic decisions can be made by anyone, often through an advice process.
    content: "A recently hired financial analyst at AES informed the CEO, Dennis
      Bakke, that he was intending to leave his role to go back to his native
      Pakistan and research the opportunity for electricity-generating capacity
      there on behalf of AES. Bakke expressed skepticism, telling him that
      despite encouragement from the U.S. Department of State to expand into
      Pakistan several years earlier, they declined due to concern over high
      levels of corruption there.\r

      \r

      Despite the CEO’s recommendation, the analyst decided to go to
      Pakistan, effectively creating a new position for himself as business
      developer, retaining his previous salary. Six months later, he invited
      Bakke to Pakistan to meet the prime minister. Two and a half years later,
      a $ 700 million power plant was running.^[ Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  - topic: Purchasing and Investments
    title: AES provides its workers a high level of autonomy in their area of
      expertise which enables them to negotiate multi-million dollar plant
      investments. Interdisciplinary volunteer task forces supported by a few
      people from headquarters with relevant expertise collectively do budget
      planning and auditing.
    content: "Like their counterparts at [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) and [Sun
      Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics/), teams at
      [AES](http://www.ase.com/) were responsible for decisions relating to all
      aspects of day-to-day operations including investment related budgeting,
      hiring, training, evaluations, compensation, capital expenditures, and
      purchasing, as well as long-term strategy and charitable giving.
      [AES](http://www.ase.com/) is an energy provider, operating thermal and
      hydroelectric power plants as well as electrical grids. This equipment is
      absolutely central to the lives of many people and businesses. A
      front-page article in the Wall Street Journal by reporter Alex Markels
      illustrates with a story how far teams at [AES](http://www.ase.com/) went
      with taking on responsibilities typically handled by headquarters:


      \\

      *MONTVILLE, Conn. –– His hands still blackened from coal he has just
      unloaded from a barge, Jeff Hatch picks up the phone and calls his
      favorite broker. “What kind of rate can you give me for $10 million at 30
      days?” he asks the agent, who handles Treasury bills. “Only 6.09? But I
      just got a 6.13 quote from Chase.” In another room, Joe Oddo is working on
      J.P. Morgan & Co. “6.15 at 30 days?” confirms Mr. Oddo, a maintenance
      technician at AES Corp.’s power plant here. “I’ll get right back to you.”
      Members of an ad-hoc team that manages a $33 million plant investment
      fund, Messrs. Oddo and Hatch quickly confer with their associates, then
      close the deal. … It sounds like “empowerment” gone mad. Give workers more
      autonomy in their area of expertise? Sure. Open the books to employee
      purview? Perhaps. But what good could possibly come from handing corporate
      finance duties to workers whose collective borrowing experience totals a
      mortgage, two car loans, and some paid-off credit-card debt? Plenty of
      good, says AES. … “The more you increase individual responsibility, the
      better the chances for incremental improvements in operations,” argues
      Dennis W. Bakke, the company’s chief executive and one of its founders. …
      “And more importantly” he says “it makes work a lot more fun.” Is giving
      coal handlers investment responsibility risky? Mr. Bakke thinks not. He
      notes that the volunteer team in Montville does have a financial adviser,
      and they work within a narrow range of investment choices. They aren’t
      exactly buying derivatives. What the CEO likes about the arrangement is
      that “they’re changed people by this experience. They’ve learned so much
      about the total aspect of the business, they’ll never be the same.”*
      ^[Alex Markels, \"Blank Check,\" The Wall Street Journal, April 9, 1998)]

      At AES, every team established its investment budget once a year.
      Budgets would be added up at the plant level, sometimes running as high as
      $300 million in a year. When teams were satisfied with the consolidated
      budget for the plant, it was reviewed, together with those from all other
      plants, by a budget task force that would suggest possible changes and
      improvements (but didn’t have power to enforce changes). That task force
      was staffed with a few people from headquarters with relevant expertise,
      but predominantly with people from local units with all sorts of
      backgrounds - a security guard could sit next to a technician and an
      engineer. Internal audits were performed in the same way, by volunteer
      task forces: each plant would be audited by colleagues from other
      plants.\r

      \r

      AES found out that using voluntary task forces instead of fixed
      staff functions has multiple benefits. Employees find avenues to express
      talents and gifts that their primary role might not call for. They develop
      a true sense of ownership and responsibility when they see they have real
      power to shape their company. Founder Dennis Bakke insists on another
      point: these task forces are formidable learning institutions. At any
      point in time, thousands of people would be involved in task forces,
      picking up technical and leadership skills from more experienced
      colleagues. It’s a modern-day form of apprenticeship, scaled to a massive
      level. No classroom training could ever provide the amount of learning
      that was taking place day in and day out in the voluntary task
      forces.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
