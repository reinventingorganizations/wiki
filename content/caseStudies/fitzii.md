  - topic: Organizational Structure
    content: "Fitzii is organized in three parallel teams along functional lines –
      product & development, sales & marketing, and hiring success. Each has a
      senior person who plays a strategy and planning role but has no authority
      over other team members (Fitzii uses the advice process and other
      peer-based processes for decision making).\r

      \r

      Fitzii maintains a Venn diagram to show the relationship between its
      three teams. Each team is responsible for its own plans; every combination
      of two teams has shared plans where their work overlaps; and finally,
      certain topics rest in the center of the Venn where any changes require
      input from all three teams. “Center of the Venn” topics include Fitzii’s
      evolutionary purpose, strategy and thematic goals, product and service
      changes that could significantly affect customers, and people and culture
      practices such as self-management."

      illustrate where teams overlap and share decision making
  - topic: Meetings
    title: Fitzii uses a variety of regular meetings and traditional and innovative
      meeting practices to encourage team-building, information-sharing, and
      decision-making.
    content: "In addition to as-needed meetings, Fitzii uses regular meeting
      practices.\r

      \r

      Monthly whole team meetings – all regular Fitzii coworkers attend a
      monthly meeting that alternates between its two offices. For a team who
      work from two locations and often telework, this ensures one predictable
      occasion to meet together face-to-face. The agenda regularly includes
      wholeness activities such as a getting-to-know one coworker activity, as
      well as financial review to increase the financial awareness of every team
      member and promote ownership thinking. Other topics are added, to a shared
      document (no one person controls the agenda), by anyone who wants the
      whole team’s input on any topic.\r

      \r

      One-on-one meetings – traditional manager-employee one-on-one
      meetings have been replaced with rotating one-on-one meetings between
      random pairings of individuals. These meetings, called “Teal Dates”, serve
      to strengthen bonds, increase understanding of other roles, and provide a
      predictable first point of contact for the advice process. Each Teal Date
      pairing lasts three months.\r

      \r

      Generally, sound meeting practices and facilitation are highly
      valued, ex. De Bono techniques, task-based learning techniques, and the
      company’s own Doozy of a Question (DOAQ) meeting style are examples."
  - topic: Coordination
    title: Key to Fitzii’s coordination is a weekly update on the company’s social
      network
    content: >-
      At [Fitzii](https://www.fitzii.com/go/about/), weekly updates take place
      in an enterprise social network, called Yammer, which is key for sharing
      information and receiving advice. Every core team member writes a weekly
      update of her/his work activities, advice processes, and concerns.


      Fitzii’s weekly updates are essential to its communication. Weekly updates ensure every team member has regular access to a wide variety of information about the business – everything from financial performance to customer concerns and the personal engagement of the individual – resulting in increased alignment and engagement of Fitzii team members. Fitzii’s ownership and advisory board are also members of the Yammer group, and they occasionally add comments of encouragement or raise difficult questions within the weekly updates or at advisory board meetings.
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Hiring software and services provider - Canada - 10 employees – For
      profit  Each team does its own hiring and members of other teams
      participate in panel interviews; fit is evaluated using why/how/what
      framework.
    content: >-
      [Fitzii](http://www.fitzii.com/), a recruitment company, follows rigorous
      processes to evaluate new hires’ potential for success – including
      psychometric testing and in-depth panel interviews. Hiring decisions rest
      with the team doing the hiring, with representatives of every other team
      involved in panel interviews. Focus is on ensuring the new hire will
      experience meaningful work and be supported by the Fitzii team.


      When hiring core team members, three essential types of fit are evaluated: • Why – alignment with Fitzii’s evolutionary purpose is evaluated in conversation during preliminary and panel interviews; there is a strong desire to find roles for people with clear purpose alignment • How – an individual’s behavioural traits, evaluated by psychometric testing within the Fitzii software • What – knowledge, skills, abilities related to the main role(s) the new hire will play, evaluated by the relevant functional team


      These may or may not be equally important in every hire. For example, hiring a programmer requires a high level of knowledge, skill, and ability (what) whereas hiring a senior person who will set strategy requires a high level of purpose alignment (why).
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: At Fitzii, coworkers have freedom to work anywhere there is internet
      connection and responsibility to achieve the benefits of in-person
      connections.
    content: In considering working hours and location,
      [Fitzii](https://www.fitzii.com/go) “manages a polarity” between freedom
      and responsibility. Coworkers can work anywhere there is internet
      connection (freedom). Flexibility is greatly enjoyed by individuals who
      are productive working from home or have occasional needs, ex. one
      coworker spent a week working in Miami in order to visit a sick relative.
      In practice, coworkers work primarily from two offices – one in Oakville,
      Ontario and the other in Toronto, Ontario. In an effort to spend time
      together in person – the CEO is often heard saying “you can’t build
      community unless you waste time together” – coworkers make every effort to
      work from Oakville on Tuesdays and from Toronto on Thursdays
      (responsibility). Monthly in-person team meetings rotate between the two
      locations; an annual in-person team retreat provides quality structured
      and unstructured interaction.
  - topic: Job Titles and Job Descriptions
    title: Fitzii has no set job descriptions; coworkers perform one or more roles
      based on their interests, talents, and the needs of the organization. A
      standard job title practice gives both guidance and flexibility when a
      title is useful.

      [Fitzii](https://www.fitzii.com/go) has no set job descriptions; coworkers
      perform one or more roles based on their interests, talents, and the needs
      of the organization.


      Coworkers have one core role. Based on that core role, they are members of one of three functional teams – product & development, sales & marketing, and hiring success. Coworkers also have other roles not related to their core role. For convenience, simple lists of these roles exist in the company social network. They are as simple as “Hiring practice - Luz” so that it’s easy to identify the person currently playing a role.


      Otherwise, roles are not described per se; but if the goal of a traditional job description is to make clear what each person should be doing, the equivalent source of guidance is each team’s goals and plans document, which makes clear the current priorities of that team. In that sense, a coworker’s job description is to make progress on Fitzii’s purpose, specifically by achieving the goals and plans her functional team has committed to.


      Regarding job titles, it is common practice to use one’s team name as a title. For example – introducing oneself as “Carla from hiring success” or signing an email: Carla, Hiring Success, Fitzii. At the same time, in situations when it is more practical to use a conventional title, each person has freedom to do so. For example, it might be practical for a member of the sales & marketing team to identify himself as Fitzii’s marketing manager when addressing marketing services vendors. There is either enough peer pressure or good sense to avoid fancier ego-driven titles!
