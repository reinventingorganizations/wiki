introduction: "**Buurtzorg Nederland** is a Dutch home-care organization which
  has attracted international attention for its innovative use of independent
  nurse teams in delivering relatively low-cost care. Buurtzorg is Dutch for
  “neighborhood care”.


  **History**


  It was founded in 2006 in the small city of Almelo by Jos de Blok and a
  small team of professional nurses who were dissatisfied with the delivery of
  health care by traditional home care organizations in the Netherlands.
  According to Sharda S. Nandram, the company has created a new management
  approach: “integrating simplification,” characterized by a simple, flat
  organizational structure through which a wide range of services, facilitated
  by information technology, can be provided.\r

    title: Buurtzorg + approach
    content: "Two nurses on a Buurtzorg team found themselves pondering the fact
      that elderly people, when they fall, often break their hips. Hip
      replacements are routine surgery, but patients don’t always recover the
      same autonomy. Could Buurtzorg play a role in preventing its older
      patients from falling down? The two nurses experimented and created a
      partnership with a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist from
      their neighborhood. They advised patients on small changes they could
      bring to their home interiors, and changes of habits that would minimize
      risks of falling down. Other teams showed interest, and the approach, now
      called Buurtzorg +, has spread throughout the country.\r

      \r

      The two nurses sensed a need, and with the power of self-management
      acted upon it. Self-management helped the idea to spread. Any team
      interested in Buurtzorg + can sign up for a training event that teaches
      them the basics of how the concept works and how to create such a
      partnership in their neighborhood.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

    title: Has grown from 4 people in 2007 to 10,000 employees in 2016 without using
      any marketing.
    content: >-
      At [Buurtzorg](https://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/), with a 10,000 people
      organization only 45 people work at the head office and there is no
      marketing department. In fact, since the organization was started in 2007
      they have not used any conventional marketing at all. From the beginning
      Buurtzorg focused on patients and on solving problems.


      "We believed this would create a better result. We would not use any marketing, instead use free publicity when people were satisfied with our services.", says Jos de Blok. Today Buurtzorg work a lot on establishing close and genuine relationships with patients, different stakeholders and other people with a natural interest in their services. Because of the success of the organization, this also includes communication with media and newspapers in an effort to meet the interest that has been generated by many years of good word of mouth. "Buurtzorg has become associated with something “good” now, so it is easier for us nowadays.", says Jos de Blok.
  - topic: Organizational Structure
    title: Buurtzorg uses a geographically-based parallel team structure and team
      coaches.
    content: "At Buurtzorg, a Dutch neighbourhood nursing organization, nurses work
      in teams of 10 to 12, with each team serving around 50 patients in a
      small, well-defined neighbourhood. The team is in charge of all tasks that
      were previously fragmented across different departments.\r

      \r

      Each team has a coach. The coach has no decision-making power and
      works with 40 to 50 teams at a time, making sure that no one team becomes
      overly dependent on the coach. The coach's role is to ask insightful
      questions that help teams find their own solutions.\r

      \r

      The team is responsible for doing the intake, planning, vacation
      scheduling as well as administration. They even decide where to rent an
      office and how to decorate it. There is no leader within the team;
      important decisions are made collectively.\r

      \r

      Because of this, a problem-solving culture thrives. Nurses can't
      offload difficult decisions to a boss and when things get tense,
      stressful, or unpleasant, there is no boss and no structure to blame The
      team knows they have all the power and latitude to solve their own
      problems.\r

      \r

      The teams of nurses aren't simply empowered by their hierarchy. They
      are truly powerful because there is no hierarchy that has decision-making
      power over them. Each team is also responsible for their own recruitment.
      Because the team members make hiring decisions themselves, they are
      emotionally invested in making the recruit successful.\r

      \r

      The absence of rules and procedures imposed by headquarters staff
      functions creates a huge sense of freedom and responsibility throughout
      the organization.\r

      \r

      The results achieved by Buurtzorg speak for themselves. A 2009 Ernst
      & Young study found that Buurtzorg requires, on average, close to 40
      percent fewer hours of care per client than other nursing organizations.
      This is despite the fact that nurses in Buurtzorg take time for coffee and
      talk with patients, their families, and neighbors, while other nursing
      organizations have come to tightly allocate the time allowed for almost
      every service. . At Buurtzorg, patients stay in care only half as long,
      heal faster, and become more autonomous."
  - topic: Information Flow
    title: Uses information structure and transparency to provide the best service
      to the customers
    content: At[ Buurtzorg](https://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/), all data
      concerning performance of all the teams is put on the company's intranet.
      A team that struggles in one area can identifiy a team in the neighborhood
      with outstanding results (which is not a threat, but an offer) and can ask
      for advice and best practices. If there is an need for a decision, the
      request is posted on the intranet. Teams can see every month how their
      productivity compares to that of other teams. The data of other teams is
      not anonymized or averaged out. Employees are trusted to handle the
      positive and negative impacts of information with integrity.

      #### Team decision making procedure


      [Buurtzorg](https://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/) teams use a very efficient method for problem solving and decision-making. They first choose a facilitator. The facilitator is not allowed to make any statements, suggestions, or decisions; she can only ask questions: “What is your proposal?” Or “What is the rationale for your proposal?”. All responses are listed on a flipchart.


      Then all are reviewed, improved and refined.


      In a third round, proposals are put up for decision. The basis for decision-making is not consensus. For a solution to be adopted it is enough that nobody has a principled objection. A person cannot veto a decision because she feels another solution (for example, hers!) would have been preferable. The perfect solution that all would embrace wholeheartedly might not exist, and its pursuit could prove exhausting. As long as there is no principled objection, a solution will be adopted, with the understanding that it can be revisited at any time when new information is available.  


      If, despite their training and meeting techniques, teams get stuck, they can ask for external facilitation at any time.


      #### Limiting ‘higher level’ regional coach meetings:


      In many ways it would make good sense for Jos de Blok, CEO of Buurtzorg to meet regularly with the regional coaches: they have great insight into what’s happening in the field. Collectively, they could spot issues and opportunities and determine actions to take.


      But this process would now be like an executive management committee--the opposite of what they want.


      To avoid this, Jos de Block limits his meetings with the coaches to quarterly.

    title: At Buurtzorg, all nurses are trained in “Intervisie,” a peer-coaching
      technique that originated in the Netherlands.
    content: >-
      **Example for Peer coaching**


      A nurse that wrestles with a certain question can ask colleagues on her team to help her sort it out in a group coaching session. How should she deal with a client that refuses to take lifesaving medication? How can she help an elderly patient accept help from his children? How to say no to clients to protect herself from burnout? Often, when a nurse struggles with one of these matters, it is because the question brings up a broader personal issue she hasn’t worked through. In these cases, a peer coaching session can help. Some Buurtzorg teams allot an hour for peer coaching every month; other teams convene when a team member requests it. “Intervisie”, the process used at Buurtzorg, follows a strict format and ground rules to prevent the group from administering the all-too-common medicine of advice, admonitions, or reassurance. During most of the process, team members can ask only open-ended questions; they become fellow travelers into the mystery of the issue the person is dealing with. A safe space is created that invites deep listening, authenticity, and vulnerability - the necessary ingredients for inner truth to emerge. The goal is for the nurse to see the problem in a new light and discover her own solutions. It is at once a simple and beautiful process. Being respectfully and compassionately “held” by a group is for many people a new and unforgettable experience.

    title: At Buurtzorg where 9000 nurses are scattered over the country, the
      internal social network ‘BuurtzorgWeb’ plays a critical role in knowledge
      sharing
    content: >-
      At [Buurtzorg](http://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/), the company’s internal
      social network, “BuurtzorgWeb” plays a key role in the sharing of
      knowledge. When there is vast knowledge spread throughout the organization
      - the trick can be finding it. With BuurtzorgWeb, nurses can easily locate
      and contact a colleague with a specific expertise. Questions can be posted
      online in a continuous stream, similar to Facebook. Due to the high
      engagement level on the platform, each question is seen by thousands of
      colleagues in a few hours and attracts one or several responses.


      In an example of how an initiative might scale in a Teal organization, a Buurtzorg team in the countryside recently developed a new concept - a boarding house for patients, to offer the patient’s primary caregiver a break. This concept was presented to all colleagues at a company retreat. Nobody at Buurtzorg made the call that this fit or did not fit Buurtzorg’s purpose or that resources should be allocated to scale the initiative. The concept will have to run its own course. If it is meant to scale, it will attract nurses in other teams to make it happen organically.
