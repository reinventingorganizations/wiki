    title: An internal recruitment process in which future colleagues interview
      candidates for a role.
    content: "At Sun Hydraulics, minor role changes often take place organically, by
      people simply stepping up to take on a role or opening a conversation
      about the need for someone to take on that role.\r

      \r

      When a larger role is created or an existing set of roles becomes
      available (say there is a need for an automation engineer), an internal
      recruitment process takes place.  Candidates are interviewed by the
      colleagues who will work most closely with the person filling the new
      role."

    title: At Sun Hydraulics all new hires start with a manufacturing tour in which
      they learn to operate several work stations before they take on the roles
      they were hired for.

      At [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/), all new hires start
      with a “manufacturing tour,” no matter what their future role will be;
      they learn to operate not just one, but several work stations. For hourly
      employees, the tour lasts for two to four weeks, and they work in four to
      six different areas. For salaried employees, it takes even longer: one to
      four months on the shop floor. Only then do they take on the roles they
      were hired for.


      Why such a long induction? People at Sun Hydraulics believe it’s critical to build relationships with other employees across the company to understand it from all angles. A self-managing environment provides opportunity to make things happen, to freely reach out to colleagues, to discuss change without going through a hierarchy of approvals. The more people you know, the more you understand the whole, the more you’ll be able to come up with new ideas and turn them into reality. At Sun Hydraulics, it is not unusual that after the manufacturing tour, new hires end up taking up a role that wasn’t the one they were hired for. They stumble upon a new interest or some urgent need and end up in a different place.
