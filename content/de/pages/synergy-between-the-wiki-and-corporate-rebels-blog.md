# DRAFT

The idea is to potentially cross reference cases description articles from wiki to CR, and vice versa, where appropriate.

The wiki has its style for describing practices : it shall be concise, practical, neutral in tone. Its primary purpose is to serve as a practical guide for leaders who are reinventing their organization and are looking for inspiration as they upgrade specific management practices in their organization.

Corporate Rebels blog has it own style and purpose.

We are convinced that the multiplicity of views makes the openness and strength of the new organizational paradigms we are witnessing.

By linking the cases of organizations that are living these new practices today, we canfacilitate access to resources that speak differently about the reinvention of organizations. 

A typical example can be Morning Star case for Conflict Resolution.
Here is the Wiki article : https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/de/cases/morning-star/
Here is the Rebels article : https://corporate-rebels.com/accountability-process/

Dear all in the wiki team, please go to the Trello xxx map for your feedback.
