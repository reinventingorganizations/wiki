introduction: >
  Happy was founded in the UK by Henry Stewart as Happy Computers in Dec 1987.
  The aim was to make learning about software an enjoyable experience.


  A key turning point was in 1992 when Henry read Maverick by Ricardo Semler and realised that organisations could be based on trust and freedom.


  In the 2000s the company expanded into leadership and personal development and changed its name to Happy.


  Another key turning point came in 2017 when the company adopted the ideas of David Marquet and the two key leaders decided to make no decisions. The company expanded by 20% annually in the years following.


  As of 2021 Happy provides IT training, leadership and personal development and apprenticeships and seeks to create happy, productive workplaces.


  In 2021 Happy employs 25 permanent staff and around 50 associates. Its turnover is around £2.2 million

  - topic: Organizational Structure
    title: A lattice organization
    content: >-
      You can’t say there is no hierarchy at Happy, as there are two clear
      leaders: Henry Stewart, founder and Chief Happiness Officer, and Cathy
      Busani, Managing Director. However there isn’t a rigid structure.


      There are three departments: Happy Computers (IT Training), Happy People (leadership and personal development) and apprenticeships (funded in the UK by an Apprenticeship levy that every organisation has to pay).


      Each department does have a Head but it is not necessarily a relationship between them and the people in those departments. Each person chooses who they would like to be their “M&M”. The title M&M was chosen by the staff and means Multiplier and Mentor - although the role is more of a coach.


      Where staff work in a team, there is a team job description, rather than individual ones. That means that people can choose which roles in the team they want to play and these often shift.


      There is a regular staff meeting (fortnightly before the pandemic, weekly during it). This will decide anything that affects everybody.


      There is also a monthly Joyful meeting. This includes Henry, the heads of department and people elected by the staff as “potential leaders”. Anybody can attend this meeting.

      Wherever possible the teams make their own decisions, without referring to the head of that department.


      [Happy’s organisation chart](https://happycomputers-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/henry_happy_co_uk/ETTTuvaVZXJDpRhWRah6GpwBTNJr5kaEibA8LAcUfR5WPA?e=dm91fe) is a series of circles with the picture of the person inside. It includes:


      * Job title

      * When they work

      * Whether they are an activist, pragmatist, reflector or theorist  (Honey and Mumford)

      * Their 5 key strengths based on Strengthfinder (R)


      The colours show their communication style, when at ease (*external circle*) and when under pressure (*internal circle*)


      * Red = Driver, 

      * Yellow = Expressive, 

      * Green = Amiable, 

      * Blue = Analytical


      The arrows indicate who coaches who.

      The chart is the work of two front-line staff who were pre-approved to come up with it.
  - topic: Budgeting and Controlling
    title: Metrics to align spending with income
    content: >-
      Some areas of the budget are fixed, such as rent, rates, service charge.


      For flexible areas, we seek to use metrics that align with income such as trainer costs, manuals, food, ice cream. The trainer cost is expected to be at most 35% of income generated and the other costs at most 15% - giving a net profit of 50%.


      In marketing it is expected that each pound spent generates 5x that in revenue.


      These metrics enable each individual in the company to work to these ratios without needing any approval from above.


      While the company does work to a P&L based on its financial year, there is very little time (at most one short meeting) spent on deciding the budget, as most of it is based on these metrics.
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: People have complete control over hours
    content: >-
      “*People know what their responsibilities are*”, explains Henry Stewart,
      the co-founder. “*They don’t need anybody else to tell them whether they
      need to be in the office or not*.”


      “I remember before the pandemic I was showing somebody around the office; he commented that only 5 out of our 25 staff members were in the office and asked where the others were. ‘I have no idea,’ I commented. People are judged by the results they deliver, not the amount of time they spend in the office.”


      There are a range of flexible hours. Some work part-time. Some work compressed hours (eg, the full week in 4 days). There are no set hours, people work when they want around their responsibilities.


      Around 2000 the leadership became aware that our admin team of 9 people wanted to work more flexibly. So they set out the terms, that there was a need for two more people in the office from 9 to 5.30 each day to answer the phone. People then decided between themselves when they would work, with some coming in at 6am (to avoid the London commute) and not many people working on Friday afternoons!


      Nowadays it wouldn’t be the leadership who would set out the requirement; the team would do it by itself.


      Decisions to be made on when people are in, and what meetings are for, are now all made within the team.
  - topic: Objectives and Target Setting
    title: Radical disruption rather than targets
    content: >-
      In 2018 Happy held a vote on whether to continue with annual performance
      appraisals. The vote was 82% against. 


      The company has tried different sorts of targets, including OKRs. The problem was that many of the staff members, especially the facilitators, would have similar targets for years. So at a six-monthly Happy Day (the Happy Day is basically a full company away day), one of the staff members came up with the idea of a radical disruption: one thing to do radically different in the next 4 months.

      This is now included in a four-monthly snapshot session with their M&M/coach, described here :

  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Don't ask questions, get people to do the job
    content: >-
      One of Happy’s core principles is that recruitment should be based on
      people’s ability to do the job, not how they talk about doing the job.


      *Example of a Facilitator interview:* Happy interviews are organized in groups, with typically 6 people at once. They ask the people to do the job immediately, for instance facilitating a 20 min session. 

      The group interviews allow Happy to see how people interact and whether they are positive and supportive of each other. The session shows whether they have the potential to train in the Happy style.

      In the second interview they will take the person aside and give them some coaching on how to improve. They then go back and they see if they have responded to the feedback. Ability to learn is a key criterion.


      Same for other roles : Happy puts people in the situation, and observes **competencies** (ability to do the job, or the potential to), **attitude** (not qualifications) and also **how they interact in teams** (recruitment is  made with 6 people to be sure that they will be able to regulate and self-manage themselves within their teams). 

      Happy also aims for collaborative interviews, with as many as possible of the people who will work with the new recruits and then they provide a very detailed feedback to the people.


      One of Happy’s core recruitment principles to have this working is : don't leave candidates to guess what is needed. Make it absolutely clear. 



      More Happy recruitment principles can be found [here](https://happycomputers-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/henry_happy_co_uk/ETBO383Or3hFsICB15Mvd2sB1_1FXt0yN4cH35OBlY0qtw?e=qcBFUj); the vision (purpose) and core values of the organization to be shared with candidates are very clear in this document.
  - topic: Feedback and Performance Management
    title: Got rid of performance appraisals
    content: >
      In 2018 Happy held a vote on whether to continue with annual performance
      appraisals. The vote was 82% against. Instead people have a four monthly
      snapshot session with their coach: 

      Of course it still makes sense to carry out a regular review, so they replaced it with a four-monthly happy@happy snapshot. The form used can be accessed [here](https://happycomputers-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/henry_happy_co_uk/ETTTuvaVZXJDpRhWRah6GpwBTNJr5kaEibA8LAcUfR5WPA?e=dm91fe). It is inspired by something they saw at the food company Cook. It highlights disruptions, successes, aspirations, contribution to unity and joy.


      1. **Radical Disruption -** choose one thing that you will do completely differently in the next period.

      2. **Strengths, Responsibilities and Values as pillars of Successes and Aspirations** 
         Happy uses Strengthfinder to discover each person’s five key **strengths**, as well as working with them on what motivates them and what makes them “feel magnificent”. They want people to do what they are good at, for their sake and for Happy’s. So they explore which strengths they have used and which they will use going ahead.
         At Happy people aren’t generally given **responsibilities** or promotions. Instead they encourage people to seek opportunities, to decide what responsibility they are able to take on. One example was two of their front-line staff who decided their prices needed updating. As is the Happy way, they consulted with colleagues and clients and checked the market. And then they took responsibility and made the decision, without needing upward approval on what to change to.
         Happy doesn’t want **[core values]**(https://www.happy.co.uk/about-us/) to be just a laminated poster stuck on the wall. So the snapshot is a good opportunity to explore where they have “believed the best”, “helped people feel good about themselves”, “celebrated mistakes”, “delighted the customer” or “made the world a better place”.
      3. **Contribution to unity and joy**  
          **Unity/Inclusiveness**
         At Happy, it is not enough to be good at your core job. They believe their values are clear and they expect everybody to be positive and supportive of others and – even in a difficult conversation – to leave them feeling good about themselves. So a crucial element of the form is to ask what they have done to achieve more unity and inclusiveness. That can be anything from little things like taking lunch with different colleagues or checking in with people in other departments..
         **Joy at Work**
         The aim is that everybody at Happy finds joy in their work at least 80% of the time. They ask their people to measure it for themselves and to think about what would bring them joy. It leads to a very different conversation to ask “What would give you more joy?”, instead of “How can we improve your performance?”.
