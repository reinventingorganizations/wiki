introduction: >-
  From its own website [Sun Hydraulics](https://www.sunhydraulics.com/about) is
  a leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance screw-in hydraulic
  cartridge valves and manifolds that control force, speed and motion as
  integral components in fluid power systems.


  In business since 1970 and a public company since 1997, Sun Hydraulics Corporation became Helios Technologies (NASDAQ: SNHY) in 2018. Sun Hydraulics LLC operates as a wholly owned company under the new corporate name and sells its products globally, primarily through independent distributors, to diverse markets of mobile and industrial equipment and machinery manufacturers.

  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: An internal recruitment process in which future colleagues interview
      candidates for a role.
    content: "At Sun Hydraulics, minor role changes often take place organically, by
      people simply stepping up to take on a role or opening a conversation
      about the need for someone to take on that role.\r

      \r

      When a larger role is created or an existing set of roles becomes
      available (say there is a need for an automation engineer), an internal
      recruitment process takes place.  Candidates are interviewed by the
      colleagues who will work most closely with the person filling the new
      role."
  - topic: Onboarding
    title: At Sun Hydraulics all new hires start with a manufacturing tour in which
      they learn to operate several work stations before they take on the roles
      they were hired for.
    content: >-
      At [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/), all new hires start
      with a “manufacturing tour,” no matter what their future role will be;
      they learn to operate not just one, but several work stations. For hourly
      employees, the tour lasts for two to four weeks, and they work in four to
      six different areas. For salaried employees, it takes even longer: one to
      four months on the shop floor. Only then do they take on the roles they
      were hired for.


      Why such a long induction? People at Sun Hydraulics believe it’s critical to build relationships with other employees across the company to understand it from all angles. A self-managing environment provides opportunity to make things happen, to freely reach out to colleagues, to discuss change without going through a hierarchy of approvals. The more people you know, the more you understand the whole, the more you’ll be able to come up with new ideas and turn them into reality. At Sun Hydraulics, it is not unusual that after the manufacturing tour, new hires end up taking up a role that wasn’t the one they were hired for. They stumble upon a new interest or some urgent need and end up in a different place.

  - topic: Feedback and Performance Management
    title: Sun Hydraulics has developed a simple process for framing positive annual
      appraisals.
    content: >-
      [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/) uses four simple
      statements in order to frame a positive discussion around performance:


      * State an admirable feature about the employee.

      * Ask what contributions they have made to Sun.

      * Ask what contributions they would like to make at Sun.

      * Ask how Sun can help them.


      Feedback about how individuals can improve is given in the natural course of events throughout the year and not saved up for the annual appraisal.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 186]

    title: Sun Hydraulics dropped most formalities of project planning, thereby
      freeing up productive capacity.
    content: At [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics/) project and investment
      management is radically simplified. There is no management that wants to
      understand and control the complexity. Projects happen organically and
      informally. Engineers are typically working on several projects in
      parallel. They constantly rearrange their priorities, based on what they
      sense is the most important, most urgent, or most fun to do. Google has
      the famous practice of “20 percent time” - engineers are free to decide
      how to spend their Fridays. Sun and other self-managing organizations
      basically extend this to the whole week. There is no master plan. There
      are no project charters and no one bothers with staffing people on
      projects. Project teams form organically and disband again when work is
      done. Nobody knows if projects are on time or on budget, because for 90
      percent of the projects, no one cares to put a timeline on paper or to
      establish a budget. A huge amount of time is freed by dropping all the
      formalities of project planning - writing the plan, getting approval,
      reporting on progress, explaining variations, rescheduling, and
      re-estimating, not to mention the politics that go into securing resources
      for one’s project or to find someone to blame when projects are over time
      or over budget. When Kirsten Regal, one of Sun’s leaders, was asked about
      how little their meeting rooms seemed to be used, she quipped, “We don’t
      waste time being busy.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations.

  - topic: Budgeting and Controlling
    title: An example of a budget-free approach of Sun Hydraulics, a publicly listed
      company in the United States
    content: >-
      The case of [Sun Hydraulics](https://www.sunhydraulics.com/) shows that a
      budget-free approach is possible even for a publicly listed company. Allen
      Carlson, the CEO, explains: "*After our IPO in January 1997, we had to get
      better at predicting our numbers. … The market penalized us when we missed
      one quarter in ‘99 after we adopted a new manufacturing system. We said,
      'Look, we can’t predict what’s going on in the economy, and we have no
      idea what our orders will look like a year from now. … We don’t run this
      business by the numbers. The numbers will be doing what the numbers will
      be doing; we can just give you a good picture of what the next quarter
      will bring.' So, we got away from making annual projections and started
      just doing quarterly forecasts. … We know our performance in the long run
      will be a result of just doing the right things every day."*


      \

      Most business leaders would feel naked without budgets and forecasts. When the question was put to Carlson "How do you deal with having no forecasts to compare people’s performance to? For instance, how do you know if the guys in Germany (where Sun has a plant) were doing a good job last year, if you have no target to compare against?"*,* his answer came shooting out of the barrel: *Who knows? Who cares? They are all working hard, doing the best they can. We have good people in all the places around the world and if I need that sort of scorecard I probably got the wrong person. That’s just the way we operate. … If I’m the head of sales of Sun in the US and you ask me what is the forecast, I have no clue! How could I generate one anyway? … At the end of the day, there is so much outside of your control. … It’s impossible to predict the unpredictable.*

    title: A public company since 1997 holds its commitment to Teal.
    content: "Sun Hydraulics, a company that was founded in 1970 by two engineers,
      designs and manufactures hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds. It has
      been a publicly owned company since 1997 with factories in Florida (where
      it is headquartered), Kansas, England, Germany, and Korea. Its shares are
      traded on NASDAQ, and as of June 1, 2016 Sun had a market capitalization
      of nearly $800 million. While the founder’s family still has a significant
      stake in Sun, they do not exercise majority control.^[As of March 1, 2016,
      Christine L. Koski, the daughter of the deceased founder of the Company,
      Robert E. Koski, is a member of the board of directors, and she, along
      with other family members, own or control approximately 14% of the
      outstanding shares of Sun’s common stock. Source: Sun Hydraulics
      Corporation 10-K filed March 31, 2016; p. 11.\r

      ] Sun would seem to be an important case of a company able to
      maintain a commitment to Teal despite a traditional corporate structure
      and a dispersed and fluid ownership. Maybe Teal organizations and non-Teal
      ownership can be compatible after all?"
