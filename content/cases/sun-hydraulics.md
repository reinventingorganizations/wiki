  From its own website [Sun Hydraulics](https://www.sunhydraulics.com/about) is
  a leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance screw-in hydraulic
  cartridge valves and manifolds that control force, speed and motion as
  integral components in fluid power systems.


  In business since 1970 and a public company since 1997, Sun Hydraulics Corporation became Helios Technologies (NASDAQ: SNHY) in 2018. Sun Hydraulics LLC operates as a wholly owned company under the new corporate name and sells its products globally, primarily through independent distributors, to diverse markets of mobile and industrial equipment and machinery manufacturers.

    title: " An internal recruitment process in which future colleagues interview
      candidates for a role."
    content: >-
      At Sun Hydraulics, minor role changes often take place organically, by
      people simply stepping up to take on a role or opening a conversation
      about the need for someone to take on that role.


      When a larger role is created or an existing set of roles becomes available (say there is a need for an automation engineer), an internal recruitment process takes place. Candidates are interviewed by the colleagues who will work most closely with the person filling the new role.

    title: " At Sun Hydraulics all new hires start with a manufacturing tour in
      which they learn to operate several works stations before they take on the
      roles they were hired for."

      At [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/), all new hires start with a “manufacturing tour,” no matter what their future role will be; they learn to operate not just one, but several work stations. For hourly employees, the tour lasts for two to four weeks, and they work in four to six different areas. For salaried employees, it takes even longer: one to four months on the shop floor. Only then do they take on the roles they were hired for.


      Why such a long induction? People at Sun Hydraulics believe it’s critical to build relationships with other employees across the company to understand it from all angles. A self-managing environment provides opportunity to make things happen, to freely reach out to colleagues, to discuss change without going through a hierarchy of approvals. The more people you know, the more you understand the whole, the more you’ll be able to come up with new ideas and turn them into reality. At Sun Hydraulics, it is not unusual that after the manufacturing tour, new hires end up taking up a role that wasn’t the one they were hired for. They stumble upon a new interest or some urgent need and end up in a different place.

    title: Sun Hydraulics has developed a simple process for framing positive annual
      appraisals.
    content: >-
      [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/) uses four simple
      statements in order to frame a positive discussion around performance:


      * State an admirable feature about the employee.

      * Ask what contributions they have made to Sun.

      * Ask what contributions they would like to make at Sun.

      * Ask how Sun can help them.


      Feedback about how individuals can improve is given in the natural course of events throughout the year and not saved up for the annual appraisal.[\[1]](https://sp--reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/cases/sun-hydraulics/#fn1)

      management is radically simplified. There is no management that wants to
      understand and control the complexity. Projects happen organically and
      informally. Engineers are typically working on several projects in
      parallel. They constantly rearrange their priorities, based on what they
      sense is the most important, most urgent, or most fun to do. Google has
      the famous practice of “20 percent time” - engineers are free to decide
      how to spend their Fridays. Sun and other self-managing organizations
      basically extend this to the whole week. There is no master plan. There
      are no project charters and no one bothers with staffing people on
      projects. Project teams form organically and disband again when work is
      done. Nobody knows if projects are on time or on budget, because for 90
      percent of the projects, no one cares to put a timeline on paper or to
      establish a budget. A huge amount of time is freed by dropping all the
      formalities of project planning - writing the plan, getting approval,
      reporting on progress, explaining variations, rescheduling, and
      re-estimating, not to mention the politics that go into securing resources
      for one’s project or to find someone to blame when projects are over time
      or over budget. When Kirsten Regal, one of Sun’s leaders, was asked about
      how little their meeting rooms seemed to be used, she quipped, “We don’t
      waste time being

    title: Un ejemplo de enfoque sin presupuesto de Sun Hydraulics, una empresa que
      cotiza en bolsa en Estados Unidos
    content: >-
      El caso de Sun Hydraulics demuestra que un enfoque libre de presupuesto es
      posible incluso para una compañía que cotiza en bolsa. Allen Carlson, CEO,
      explica: *"Después de nuestra OPI en enero de 1997, tuvimos que mejorar en
      la predicción de nuestros números... El mercado nos penalizó cuando
      perdimos un trimestre en 1999 después de adoptar un nuevo sistema de
      fabricación. Hemos dicho, "Mira, no podemos predecir lo que está pasando
      en la economía, y no tenemos idea de cómo se verán nuestros pedidos en un
      año a partir de ahora... No dirigimos este negocio por los números. Los
      números estarán haciendo los que los números hacen, sólo podemos darle una
      buena imagen de lo que el próximo trimestre traerá. Así que nos alejamos
      de hacer proyecciones anuales y empezamos a hacer pronósticos
      trimestrales... Sabemos que nuestro desempeño en el largo plazo será el
      resultado de hacer las cosas correctas todos los días"*. \

      \

      La mayoría de los líderes empresariales se sentirían desnudos sin presupuestos y pronósticos. Cuando le hicieron esta pregunta a Carlson: “¿Cómo manejas el hecho de que no manejar un pronóstico para comprar el desempeño de la gente? ¿Cómo sabes si los chicos de Alemania (donde Sun tiene una planta) estaban haciendo un buen trabajo el año pasado, si no tiene ningún objetivo para comparar?", Su respuesta fue pan comido: “*¿Quién sabe? ¿A quién le importa? Todos están trabajando duro, haciendo lo mejor que pueden. Tenemos buenas personas en todos los lugares alrededor del mundo y si necesito ese tipo de tarjeta de puntuación, probablemente tengo la persona equivocada. Esa es la forma en que operamos. ... Si soy el jefe de ventas de Sun en los EE.UU. y me preguntas qué es el pronóstico, no tengo ni idea! ¿Cómo podría generar uno de todos modos? ... Al final del día, hay mucho fuera de su control. ... Es imposible predecir lo impredecible.”*

    title: Una empresa pública desde 1997 mantiene su compromiso Teal.
    content: "Sun Hydraulics, una empresa que fue fundada en 1970 por dos
      ingenieros, diseña y fabrica válvulas de cartucho hidráulico y colectores.
      Ha sido una empresa de propiedad pública desde 1997 con fábricas en
      Florida (donde tiene su sede), Kansas, Inglaterra, Alemania y Corea. Sus
      acciones se negocian en NASDAQ, y al 1 de junio de 2016 Sun tenía una
      capitalización de mercado de casi $ 800 millones. Si bien la familia del
      fundador todavía tiene una participación significativa en Sun, no ejercen
      el control mayoritario. \\[9] \\[A 1 de marzo de 2016, Christine L. Koski,
      la hija del fallecido fundador de la empresa, Robert E. Koski, es miembro
      del consejo de administración, y ella, junto con otros miembros de su
      familia, posee o controla aproximadamente el 14% de las acciones
      ordinarias en circulación de Sun. Fuente: Sun Hydraulics Corporation 10-K

      importante de una empresa capaz de mantener un compromiso con Teal a pesar
      de una estructura corporativa tradicional y una propiedad dispersa y
      fluida. ¿Tal vez las organizaciones Teal y organizaciones no Teal pueden
      ser compatibles después de todo?"
