    title: Zappos.com is famous for its outstanding culture, offers its new hires a
      $3,000 check if they have second thoughts and choose to quit during the
      four- week orientation.
    content: Zappos.com is famous for its Green cultural practices described in the
      bestseller Delivering Happiness , written by CEO Tony Hsieh. Zappos
      culture is based on trust, love and respect. With values of "being open
      and honest, passionate and humble, fun and a little weird", as mentioned
      by Kevin Rose, founder of Digg.com. The idea of offering $3000 for people
      that want to leave during onboarding phase is that everyone will be better
      off not staying in a marriage that isn’t meant to be. The fit with the
      culture must be perfect, and motivation at Zappos must not come from
      money. It’s a tribute to Zappos’ outstanding culture that the percentage
      of people taking the money and leaving is only around one or two percent.
      Whenever the percentage of people taking the check draws too close to
      zero, Zappos increases the amount (it started with $100, then raised it to
      $200, and raised it again and again up to its current level). The
      practice, in essence, boils down to a real- life barometer of the health
      of the organization’s culture. The 1,500- employee company is currently
      making the leap to Holacracy, which will make it the largest holacratic
      organization to date.

      The idea is that everyone will be better off not staying in a marriage
      that isn’t meant to be. Three thousand dollars is a lot of money for
      people working in call centers or moving boxes in fulfillment centers,
      which is what most Zappos.com employees do. It’s a tribute to
      [Zappos](https://www.zappos.com/)’ outstanding culture that the percentage
      of people taking the money and leaving is only around one or two percent.
