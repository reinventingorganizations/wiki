    title: 寻找目标和激情

      几年前，斋浦尔地毯公司的人力资源部更名为“寻找神圣灵魂”。


      公司相信每个人都有自己独特的方式，他们的目标感可以为公司的更高目标添砖加瓦。


      公司招聘基于应聘者如何增加公司价值。面试问题旨在了解应聘者的目的和原则，而不是侧重于经验和学术背景。


      创始人直接参与招聘过程，并经常参加最终面试。总部的经理进行初步的面试。最终决定由所有利益相关者协商一致来作出。

    title: Connecting rural craftsmanship to global markets

      Jaipur Rugs brings rural craftsmanship to global markets via handmade
      carpets. It is a family business based in Jaipur, and offers hand-knotted
      and woven rugs made using traditional art forms. 

      The founder, Mr. Nand Kishore Chaudhary, created a business model which provides a livelihood for the artisans at their doorstep. This changed the standard practice of involving middlemen to work with artisan communities.

    title: Thinking creatively
    content: >-
      Most people don’t have a single “job” that fits a generic description.
      Rather, they fill a combination of roles. They have the space to grow and
      co-create with other departments and explore their interests. When a
      candidate joins, they have a period of probation (3-6 months) during which
      they explore their interests, and eventually decide on their work role.
      This depends on requirements from specific teams. But the idea is that
      each individual gets the chance to choose their tasks according to
      interest and passion (always given these align with company’s vision).
      This period also allows the company to assess and understand the
      candidate. So, it’s win-win. 

      Plus, employees participate in sessions where they provide feedback for management. Each department has such sessions. Additionally, the founder has an open-door policy. This is a direct platform for anyone to go and talk to the founder, which can also help individuals to talk about their roles, if and when required.

      Members fill roles that are created, exchanged and discontinued in
      response to current needs. They aren’t put in a box with a job title.
      There is space to grow and explore. 

      Some artisans become leaders, entrepreneurs or designers. 

      Leaders: A program called Bunkar Sakhi (meaning  Artisan Leader) allows artisans to receive leadership training. They then help fellow artisans to achieve best quality in their work. 

      Entrepreneurs: Jaipur Rugs artisans have opened centers of weaving in their homes. They have become tour guides for customers and visitors.

      Artist: Under the Manchaha Program (meaning Artisan Original), Jaipur Rug artisans create and design their own rugs.
