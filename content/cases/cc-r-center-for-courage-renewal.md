      **Welcoming new personnel:**


      Each existing team member brings an object symbolising a wish for their new colleague. They present it, and share their wish. This celebrates the newcomer, and makes him or her feel welcome. It also serves existing team members. They too get to know each other at a deeper level. 


      **Farewelling personnel:**


      There is a similar practice when someone leaves. Team members join in a meal with the departing colleague. Everybody prepares a personal story about that person and the organization. The stories celebrate the person who is leaving. But again, they reveal just as much about the storyteller.
