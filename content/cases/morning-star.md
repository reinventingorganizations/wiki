    title: 文化与价值观  在晨星，每一个管理活动都得到该组织两个基本价值观的赋能。

    title: 协作 在晨星，同事们通过临时协议和书面年度协议进行协调。
    content: >-
      晨星公司的同事们注意到，很多人从不同的供应商那里购买了几十种不同样式的螺纹锁固胶（一种防止螺母和螺栓意外松动的粘合剂）。他们不仅损失了大量折扣，而且不协调的采购也产生了不必要的官僚作风，因为食品行业的法规要求工人跟踪材料安全数据表中的每一种格式。一位工人建议他每季度到工厂走走一次，协调订单。一个类似的解决方案也出现在购买包装材料的业务中，数量折扣得到了大幅度增加。^\[Laloux,

      晨星的另一个关键协调机制是同事谅解书（简称CLOU）。请参见“[岗位定义与任务分派](https://cn.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/theory/role-definition-and-allocation/)”和“启发性实践案例”/“晨星”。
  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: 岗位定义和任务分派  每年举行一次，定义和分配角色的正式过程
    content: >-
      作为晨星公司的同事，每个人要写一份个人使命宣言（晨星公司用语称之为“个人商业使命”），并在一份名为“同事谅解书”（简称CLOU）的文件中详细说明你要履行的所有职责。晨星的角色定义非常明确，所以你可能有20到30个不同的角色（一个可能是卸货站的番茄接受者，另一个可能是季节性整皮分拣员的培训师）。对于每个角色，需要指定：


      * 角色的功能，

      * 你认为自己应该拥有什么样的权力（行动、推荐、决定或两者的结合），

      * 哪些指标能帮助你理解自己是否做得很好，

      * 你希望在这些指标上有什么改进。


      在像晨星这样的连续业务流程中，生产链中的每个人都会从上游的某个人那里收到某种形式的西红柿或西红柿酱，然后以另一种形式将它们送到下游的某个人那里。这或许可以解释为什么晨星的同事们选择在撰写或更新完CLOUs后，不在团队环境中集体讨论CLOUs，而是与上下游同事进行一对一的一系列讨论。


      这里是个[CLOU文档案例](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/index.php?action=ajax&title=-&rs=SecureFileStore::getFile&f=/a/a9/MorningStar_Sample2011_CLOU.pdf)。还可以点击[这里](http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments).参考更详细的CLOU资料。^\[Source: http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments]
  - topic: Conflict resolution
    title: 冲突解决  使用一种名为“直接沟通和达成协议”的冲突解决过程，这有助于各方达成协议。可以邀请一位调解人来支持协调，但协调人无权以上级角度强加一个决策。
    content: >-
      晨星内部有23个团队（称为业务部门），但没有管理职位，也没有人力资源部门。同事们完全按照其历史早期确立的自我管理原则来运作。当第一家番茄加工厂建成时，克里斯·鲁弗与公司的第一批员工会面，跟他们确认希望如何合作。他们决定，应该用两个基本的组织价值观来激励晨星的每一个管理实践：成员不应该对他人使用武力，每个人应该履行自己的承诺。这些价值观是公司冲突解决流程的核心，在“同事原则”中有详细描述。这是一份概述晨星自我管理实践的核心文件。冲突解决过程（称为“直接沟通和达成一致”）适用于解决任何类型的分歧。这可能是对技术决策的不同意见、人际冲突或价值观的违背。具体来说，当一个同事认为另一个人没有发挥作用时，这也可以用于解决绩效问题。


      不管是什么话题，这个过程都是从一个人要求另一个人达成一致开始的：在第一阶段，他们坐在一起，试图私下解决问题。发起者必须提出明确的请求（不是判决，不是要求），对方必须对请求作出明确的回应（用“是”、“否”或反建议）。


      如果他们找不到一个双方都同意的解决方案，他们就提名一个双方都信任的同事担任调解人。该同事支持各方达成协议，但不能强行提出解决方案。


      如果调解失败，将召集一个与主题相关的同事小组。该小组的作用，还是倾听并帮助本人形成协议。小组不能给当事人强加决定，但通常具有足够的道德分量，可以让事情得出结论。


      最后一步，创始人兼总裁克里斯•鲁弗（chrisrufer）可以被召入该小组，以进一步加强该小组的道德分量。由于分歧是私下的，因此各方应在谈判过程中和谈判结束后遵守保密规定。当然，这一保密规定也适用于冲突的两个核心人物。他们必须自行解决彼此之间的分歧，不鼓励通过争取支持和建立敌对派系等方式来蔓延冲突。
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: 招聘  晨星的招聘是一个非常苛刻的过程，通常包括大量的面试和一系列的评估。
    content: >-
      晨星公司的创始人克里斯•鲁弗估计，平均而言，一个新员工需要一年或更长时间的适应，才能在自我管理环境中充分发挥作用。公司规模较小时，克里斯·鲁弗（Chris
      Rufer）会花半天时间面试每一位未来的员工，通常是在应聘者家里面试。大部分的谈话集中在评估晨星的理念与申请人的期望之间的契合度。如今，每位潜在员工都会接受两小时的自我管理概念介绍，并接受10到12位晨星同事的面试。即使这样，错误还是会发生。联合创始人保罗格林（paulgreen）估计，多达50%的经验丰富的员工在两年内离职，因为他们很难适应自我管理体系。


      想要扩充业务部门成员人数的同事，必须将此想法推销给团队同事，大家会要求倡议者提供具体招聘岗位的工作描述和商业案例。如果大家一致同意则继续推进，将招聘的实施交给团队内部专家。


      重点是岗位适配和组织适配。组织适配的一个关键点是对学习热情。
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: Each colleague at Morning Star has a work schedule commitment.
    content: The work schedule commitment captures how many hours a person can
      commit to work during low and high season (when the tomatoes are harvested
      and processed), providing a clear basis on which colleagues can discuss
      and manage their time collectively whilst still fulfilling the
      organization’s purpose. The work schedule commitment is captured in
      [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/)’s colleague letter of
      understanding or CLOU, which also includes a personal mission statement
      and detailed information about the roles a person currently commits to, as
      well as improvements they hope to make. This more formal way of capturing
      commitment plays to Morning Star's need for continuous improvement to
      increase efficiency as it is essentially a low-margin, commodity
      business^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 182-183].
  - topic: Objectives and Target Setting
    title: In Morning Star, colleagues give each other an undertaking to deliver
      certain volumes, since each section is dependent on the output of the
      preceding section to deliver its output.
    content: >-
      As a [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/) colleague, you write a
      personal mission statement (“Personal Commercial Mission” in Morning
      Star’s language) and spell out all of the roles you commit to in a
      document called Colleague Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). Roles
      at Morning Star are defined very specifically, so you might well hold 20
      or 30 different roles (one might be receiver of tomatoes at the unloading
      station, another might be trainer of seasonal whole peel sorters). For
      each role, you specify what it does, what authority you believe you should
      have (act, recommend, decide, or a combination thereof), what indicators
      will help you understand if you are doing a good job, and what
      improvements you hope to make on those indicators.


      Why this level of formality and granularity? In a continuous process like Morning Star’s, each person in the chain receives tomatoes or paste in some form from someone upstream and delivers them in another form to someone downstream. Therefore, colleagues at Morning Star chose to discuss the CLOUs, once written or updated, not in a team setting (which most self-managing organizations do), but in a series of one-on-one discussions with the handful of colleagues up and down-stream that people interact with most. People discuss and negotiate what’s written in each other’s CLOU documents very seriously— they want to make sure that people upstream commit to supplying them with the right input, so that they can in turn deliver to people downstream what they committed to.


      Colleagues at Morning Star set themselves targets for their part of the process, to stimulate continuous improvement. They measure indicators, compare them to the self-set targets, analyze root causes, and experiment with new ideas. These targets are mostly set at a local level, for one machine or one process step, where the outcomes can be predicted with some certainty.
  - topic: Feedback and Performance Management
    title: Morning Star has developed a team based feedback process for when the
      work carried out can't be compared easily.
    content: "[Morning Star ](http://www.morningstarco.com/)Teams that do very
      different work (for example, tomato sorting, steam generation and
      packaging) don’t share metrics to get feedback on their performance.
      Instead, each team makes an annual self-evaluation presentation to a group
      of their colleagues. The group includes Chris Rufer, the President and
      anyone else who wants to join in. They are expected to talk openly about
      what went well, what didn’t, how well they have used company resources and
      what their plans are for the coming year. Each presentation lasts several
      hours and is carefully prepared. They expect tough questions from their
      colleagues and receive much input. This enables them to review what they
      have done and refine their plans^\\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing
      Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 124, 125]."
  - topic: Compensation and incentives
    title: Salaries are self-initiated, calibrated by the advice given by an elected
      salary committee, and if needed, using the conflict resolution process.
    content: >-
      If you work at Morning Star, then once a year, along with all your
      colleagues, you write a letter stating the raise in salary you believe to
      be fair for yourself and why. In an uneventful year, you are likely to
      stick with a cost-of-living adjustment. But if you feel you have taken on
      more challenging roles or made special contributions, you can choose a
      higher percentage. You back up the letter with the peer-based feedback you
      received from your CLOU colleagues (the people with whom you concluded
      one-on-one contracts a year earlier) and any relevant data on performance
      indicators you are responsible for.


      You then share your letter with a handful of colleagues that were elected into a compensation committee (there is one such committee in each of the company’s four locations). The committee’s job is to review all the letters it receives, calibrate them, and provide feedback. It might tell you that you’ve been too humble about your accomplishments and that you should consider going for a bigger raise. Or it might tell you that, in comparison to your peers, the salary increase you granted yourself seems on the high side. The committee has only advisory power and cannot impose its decision, but the process to set salaries is understood to be part of Morning Star's "Gaining Agreement" process. If you choose to ignore the committee's advice for you to lower your salary raise, the committee can choose to enter into the Gaining Agreement process (a [conflict resolution process](../conflict-resolution/)) with you to create a space and time to explore in more depth where your and the committee’s assessments diverge and to help you and the committee reach agreement.


      Morning Star’s experience is that people prove to be remarkably skillful at assessing a fair compensation for themselves. In any given year, roughly a quarter of people choose salary increases above the cost-of-living adjustment. Only a handful of people throughout the company receive feedback that they might have aimed too high. ^[Gary Hamel, “First, Let’s Fire All the Managers,” Harvard Business Review, December 2011, [http://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers](https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers). and interviews Frederic Laloux at Morning Star Self-Management Institute.]
  - topic: Purchasing and Investments
    title: Morning Star implemented a strong performance evaluation process, which
      includes a view on the effectiveness of using company resources and an
      annual presentation of investment plans to a panel of peers.
    content: At [Morningstar](https://www.morningstarco.com/), every year in
      January, teams present a self-evaluation to a group of colleagues, which
      inludes Chris Rufer (the founder and president) and anyone else who cares
      to join. They are expected to talk candidly about what went well during
      the past year and what didn’t, how effectively they used company
      resources, and what they plan to do in the next year. It’s not a
      superficial effort; each presentation lasts for a few hours, and teams can
      expect challenging, sometimes grilling questions from their colleagues. In
      the course of a month, all teams make presentations; teams that haven’t
      performed well have received much input from their peers and know they
      have homework to do ^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson
      Parker (2014), page 125]
  - topic: Fundamental Assumptions
    title: Two core beliefs about workers and responsibilities.
    content: |-
      1. Individuals shall work with no use of force or coercion.
      2. Individuals shall keep commitments.
  - topic: Ownership
    title: A privately held company grows without diluting its ownership.
    content: Chris Rufer founded Morningstar in 1970 and to this day owns 100% of
      the company and is its sole board member. Recognizing the potential
      hazards of having partners who might not unconditionally support his
      pursuit of self-management, he has foregone taking in new investors but
      rather has relied on loans to fund his growth. Growing in this way from a
      single truck operation to the world’s largest tomato processor (a
      traditionally low margin as well as capital intensive business) is
      extraordinary, but perhaps Chris would argue, essential to its
      success.^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 289].
  - topic: Decision Making
    title: "Morning Star uses the advice process. Here is an example: it was used
      when a new strategy was proposed that would affect all employees. "
    content: A few years ago, before the advent of internal social networks, Chris
      Rufer, the founder, owner and CEO of [Morning
      Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/), felt the need for a new strategic
      direction at Morning Star. He wrote a memo that he sent to all colleagues,
      with an invitation to a company-wide meeting (the different locations
      joined by videoconference). He shared his idea, and the reasons for it. He
      asked everyone to contact him personally after the meeting with any
      questions, concerns, comments, and advice on his plans.
  - topic: Dismissal
    title: Dismissals can be initiated by any individual, using the conflict
      resolution process if needed.
    content: >-
      At [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/), the process is almost
      identical to the one used at
      [Buurtzorg](http://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/), except that it is
      initiated by an individual rather than a team. Morning Star views a
      dismissal as the final step in a conflict and therefore uses its [conflict
      resolution](../conflict-resolution/) mechanism to deal with the situation.
      The process starts when one person asks another to leave the organization.
      Suppose that someone finds that a colleague has fundamentally breached a
      company value (perhaps the person made an important decision without
      requesting [advice ](../decision-making/)from colleagues) or that a
      colleague is failing time after time to live up to his
      [commitments](../commitment-working-hours-and-flexibility/), despite a
      number of previous attempts to improve the situation. She can initiate a
      conflict resolution process, asking her colleague to resign. If the person
      asked to leave does not agree, a four-stage conflict resolution process
      begins:


      In a first phase, they sit together and try to sort it out. In the discussion, the person asked to leave can suggest ways to restore trust. Or perhaps he will come to see that he has irrevocably lost the trust of his colleagues and that he is better off looking for work elsewhere.

      If they can’t agree on an outcome, another colleague is called in as a mediator.

      If necessary, in a third step, a panel of colleagues is asked to mediate.

      As a last resort, Chris Rufer, the founder and president, is asked to join the panel.

      People asked to mediate or sit on a panel take their role very seriously. Morning Star’s principle of not using force against anyone is at stake. They are not a jury, passing a verdict on a colleague. Their role is to explore every possible way to restore trust in the relationship. The process can take a long time if needed. Only when the person who has been asked to leave sees that colleagues genuinely tried to find a solution and that none could be found, will he come to accept that resignation is the reasonable outcome. Therein lies the power and legitimacy of the process.


      Because Morning Star views a dismissal as a private conflict between two persons, everyone is under the understanding of full confidentiality (as is always the case with the conflict resolution mechanism). As a result, no data exist of how often this happens. . Some more senior employees report that they have been part of a handful of panels over the years. They are advocates for the method. The panel discussions are never easy they report, but they do help people reach fair and reasonable outcomes^[Source: Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), pages 128-129].
