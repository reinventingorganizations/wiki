    title: At Morning Star, every management practice is inspired by two basic
      social values.
    content: "The founding principles for [Morning
      Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/)'s way of operating were set early in
      its history. When the first tomato processing factory was built, Chris
      Rufer and the company’s first employees met to define how they wanted to
      work together. They decided that two principles, two basic social values,
      should inspire every management practice at Morning Star: individuals
      should never use force against other people and they should honor their
      commitments . These principles are at the heart of the company’s conflict
      resolution mechanism, a process that is described in great detail in the
      “Colleague Principles,” a core document outlining Morning Star’s self-
      managing practices."
  - topic: Coordination
    title: At Morning Star, colleagues coordinate both ad hoc and through written
      annual agreements.
    content: >-
      Colleagues at Morningstar noticed that lots of people were buying
      threadlocker (an adhesive that prevents nuts and bolts from accidentally
      loosening) in dozens of different formats and from different vendors. They
      were not only losing out on volume discounts, but the uncoordinated
      purchasing also generated unnecessary bureaucracy because regulations in
      the food industry required workers to track every format in a Material
      Safety Data Sheet. A worker suggested that he could walk around the plant
      once a quarter to coordinate orders. A similar solution emerged for
      purchasing packaging materials where volume discounts can quickly add
      up.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to
      Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness
      (Kindle Locations 2394-2395). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]


      Another key mechanism for coordination at Morningstar is the Colleague Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). See “[Role Definition and Allocation](../role-definition-and-allocation/)" and then Concrete examples for inspiration”/”Morningstar”.
  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: A formal process for defining and allocating roles which takes place once
      each year
    content: >-
      As a Morning Star colleague, you write a personal mission statement
      (“Personal Commercial Mission” in Morning Star’s language) and spell out
      all of the roles you commit to perform in a document called the Colleague
      Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). Roles at Morning Star are
      defined very specifically, so you might well hold 20 or 30 different roles
      (one might be receiver of tomatoes at the unloading station, another might
      be trainer of seasonal whole peel sorters). For each role, you specify;


      * what it does,

      * what authority you believe you should have (act, recommend, decide, or a combination thereof),

      * what indicators will help you understand if you are doing a good job, and

      * what improvements you hope to make on those indicators.


      In a continuous process like Morning Star’s, each person in the chain receives tomatoes or paste in some form from someone upstream and delivers them in another form to someone downstream. This might explain why colleagues at Morning Star chose to discuss the CLOUs, once written or updated, not in a team setting but in a series of one-on-one discussions with colleagues up and downstream. 


      Here is a [sample CLOU document](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/index.php?action=ajax&title=-&rs=SecureFileStore::getFile&f=/a/a9/MorningStar_Sample2011_CLOU.pdf). A more detailed discussions of CLOUs can be found [here](http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments).^\[Source: http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments]
  - topic: Conflict resolution
    title: Use a conflict resolution process called the “Direct Communication and
      Gaining Agreement”, which supports parties in finding agreement. Mediators
      may be called in for support, but they cannot impose a resolution from
      above.
    content: >-
      Within Morning Star, there are 23 teams (called Business Units), but no
      management positions and no HR department. Colleagues operate entirely on
      self-managing principles that were established early in its history . When
      the first tomato processing factory was built, Chris Rufer and the
      company’s first employees met to define how they wanted to work together.
      They decided that two basic social values should inspire every management
      practice at Morning Star: individuals should never use force against other
      people and they should honor their commitments. These values are at the
      heart of the company’s conflict resolution process, which is described in
      great detail in the “Colleague Principles”. This is a core document
      outlining Morning Star’s self-managing practices. The conflict resolution
      process (called “Direct Communication and Gaining Agreement”), applies to
      any type of disagreement. This could be a difference of opinion about a
      technical decision, an interpersonal conflict or a breach of values.
      Specifically, it can be used in performance issues when one colleague
      believes that another is not pulling his weight.


      Whatever the topic, the process starts with one person asking another to gain agreement: In a first phase, they sit together and try to sort it out privately. The initiator has to make a clear request (not a judgment, not a demand), and the other person has to respond clearly to the request (with a “yes,” a “no,” or a counterproposal).


      If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both of them, they nominate a colleague they both trust to act as a mediator. The colleague supports the parties in finding agreement but cannot impose a resolution.


      If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant colleagues is convened. The panel’s role, again, is to listen and help shape agreement. It cannot force a decision, but usually carries enough moral weight for matters to come to a conclusion.


      In an ultimate step, Chris Rufer, the founder and president, can be called into the panel, to further reinforce the panel’s moral weight. Since the disagreement is private, all parties are expected to respect confidentiality during and after the processes. Of course, this confidentiality also applies to the two persons at the heart of the conflict. They must resolve their disagreement between themselves and are discouraged from spreading the conflict by enlisting support and building rival factions.

  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Recruitment in Morning Star is a very demanding process, generally
      including a multitude of interviews and a battery of diagnostics.
    content: "Chris Rufer, the founder of Morning Star, estimates that, on average,
      it takes a new associate a year or more to become fully functional in the
      self-management environment. When the company was smaller, Chris Rufer
      spent half a day interviewing every prospective employee, usually in the
      candidate’s home. The bulk of the conversation focused on assessing the
      fit between Morning Star’s philosophy and the applicant’s expectations.
      Today every potential hire gets a two-hour introduction to self-
      management and is interviewed by 10 to 12 Morning Star colleagues. Even
      then, mistakes happen. Paul Green Jr., co-founder,  estimates that as many
      as 50% of seasoned hires leave within two years because they have a hard
      time adapting to the self management system. \r

      \r

      A colleague who wants to expand a Business Unit’s pay-roll must sell
      the idea to his or her peers, who will ask for a job description and a
      business case. If there’s a consensus to move ahead, the mechanics of
      recruiting will get turned over to an in-house specialist.\r

      \r

      Emphasis is on fit for role and fit for the organization.  A major
      point in fit for organization is passion for learning."
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: Each colleague at Morning Star has a work schedule commitment.
    content: The work schedule commitment captures how many hours a person can
      commit to work during low and high season (when the tomatoes are harvested
      and processed), providing a clear basis on which colleagues can discuss
      and manage their time collectively whilst still fulfilling the
      organization’s purpose. The work schedule commitment is captured in
      [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/)’s colleague letter of
      understanding or CLOU, which also includes a personal mission statement
      and detailed information about the roles a person currently commits to, as
      well as improvements they hope to make. This more formal way of capturing
      commitment plays to Morning Star's need for continuous improvement to
      increase efficiency as it is essentially a low-margin, commodity
      business^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 182-183].
  - topic: Objectives and Target Setting
    title: In Morning Star, colleagues give each other an undertaking to deliver
      certain volumes, since each section is dependent on the output of the
      preceding section to deliver its output.
    content: >-
      As a [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/) colleague, you write a
      personal mission statement (“Personal Commercial Mission” in Morning
      Star’s language) and spell out all of the roles you commit to in a
      document called Colleague Letter of Understanding (or simply CLOU). Roles
      at Morning Star are defined very specifically, so you might well hold 20
      or 30 different roles (one might be receiver of tomatoes at the unloading
      station, another might be trainer of seasonal whole peel sorters). For
      each role, you specify what it does, what authority you believe you should
      have (act, recommend, decide, or a combination thereof), what indicators
      will help you understand if you are doing a good job, and what
      improvements you hope to make on those indicators.


      Why this level of formality and granularity? In a continuous process like Morning Star’s, each person in the chain receives tomatoes or paste in some form from someone upstream and delivers them in another form to someone downstream. Therefore, colleagues at Morning Star chose to discuss the CLOUs, once written or updated, not in a team setting (which most self-managing organizations do), but in a series of one-on-one discussions with the handful of colleagues up and down-stream that people interact with most. People discuss and negotiate what’s written in each other’s CLOU documents very seriously— they want to make sure that people upstream commit to supplying them with the right input, so that they can in turn deliver to people downstream what they committed to.


      Colleagues at Morning Star set themselves targets for their part of the process, to stimulate continuous improvement. They measure indicators, compare them to the self-set targets, analyze root causes, and experiment with new ideas. These targets are mostly set at a local level, for one machine or one process step, where the outcomes can be predicted with some certainty.
  - topic: Feedback and Performance Management
    title: Morning Star has developed a team based feedback process for when the
      work carried out can't be compared easily.
    content: "[Morning Star ](http://www.morningstarco.com/)Teams that do very
      different work (for example, tomato sorting, steam generation and
      packaging) don’t share metrics to get feedback on their performance.
      Instead, each team makes an annual self-evaluation presentation to a group
      of their colleagues. The group includes Chris Rufer, the President and
      anyone else who wants to join in. They are expected to talk openly about
      what went well, what didn’t, how well they have used company resources and
      what their plans are for the coming year. Each presentation lasts several
      hours and is carefully prepared. They expect tough questions from their
      colleagues and receive much input. This enables them to review what they
      have done and refine their plans^\\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing
      Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 124, 125]."
  - topic: Compensation and incentives
    title: Salaries are self-initiated, calibrated by the advice given by an elected
      salary committee, and if needed, using the conflict resolution process.
    content: >-
      If you work at Morning Star, then once a year, along with all your
      colleagues, you write a letter stating the raise in salary you believe to
      be fair for yourself and why. In an uneventful year, you are likely to
      stick with a cost-of-living adjustment. But if you feel you have taken on
      more challenging roles or made special contributions, you can choose a
      higher percentage. You back up the letter with the peer-based feedback you
      received from your CLOU colleagues (the people with whom you concluded
      one-on-one contracts a year earlier) and any relevant data on performance
      indicators you are responsible for.


      You then share your letter with a handful of colleagues that were elected into a compensation committee (there is one such committee in each of the company’s four locations). The committee’s job is to review all the letters it receives, calibrate them, and provide feedback. It might tell you that you’ve been too humble about your accomplishments and that you should consider going for a bigger raise. Or it might tell you that, in comparison to your peers, the salary increase you granted yourself seems on the high side. The committee has only advisory power and cannot impose its decision, but the process to set salaries is understood to be part of Morning Star's "Gaining Agreement" process. If you choose to ignore the committee's advice for you to lower your salary raise, the committee can choose to enter into the Gaining Agreement process (a [conflict resolution process](../conflict-resolution/)) with you to create a space and time to explore in more depth where your and the committee’s assessments diverge and to help you and the committee reach agreement.


      Morning Star’s experience is that people prove to be remarkably skillful at assessing a fair compensation for themselves. In any given year, roughly a quarter of people choose salary increases above the cost-of-living adjustment. Only a handful of people throughout the company receive feedback that they might have aimed too high. ^[Gary Hamel, “First, Let’s Fire All the Managers,” Harvard Business Review, December 2011, [http://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers](https://hbr.org/2011/12/first-lets-fire-all-the-managers). and interviews Frederic Laloux at Morning Star Self-Management Institute.]
  - topic: Purchasing and Investments
    title: Morning Star implemented a strong performance evaluation process, which
      includes a view on the effectiveness of using company resources and an
      annual presentation of investment plans to a panel of peers.
    content: At [Morningstar](https://www.morningstarco.com/), every year in
      January, teams present a self-evaluation to a group of colleagues, which
      inludes Chris Rufer (the founder and president) and anyone else who cares
      to join. They are expected to talk candidly about what went well during
      the past year and what didn’t, how effectively they used company
      resources, and what they plan to do in the next year. It’s not a
      superficial effort; each presentation lasts for a few hours, and teams can
      expect challenging, sometimes grilling questions from their colleagues. In
      the course of a month, all teams make presentations; teams that haven’t
      performed well have received much input from their peers and know they
      have homework to do ^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson
      Parker (2014), page 125]
  - topic: Fundamental Assumptions
    title: Two core beliefs about workers and responsibilities.
    content: |-
      1. Individuals shall work with no use of force or coercion.
      2. Individuals shall keep commitments.
  - topic: Ownership
    title: A privately held company grows without diluting its ownership.
    content: Chris Rufer founded Morningstar in 1970 and to this day owns 100% of
      the company and is its sole board member. Recognizing the potential
      hazards of having partners who might not unconditionally support his
      pursuit of self-management, he has foregone taking in new investors but
      rather has relied on loans to fund his growth. Growing in this way from a
      single truck operation to the world’s largest tomato processor (a
      traditionally low margin as well as capital intensive business) is
      extraordinary, but perhaps Chris would argue, essential to its
      success.^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 289].
  - topic: Decision Making
    title: "Morning Star uses the advice process. Here is an example: it was used
      when a new strategy was proposed that would affect all employees. "
    content: A few years ago, before the advent of internal social networks, Chris
      Rufer, the founder, owner and CEO of [Morning
      Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/), felt the need for a new strategic
      direction at Morning Star. He wrote a memo that he sent to all colleagues,
      with an invitation to a company-wide meeting (the different locations
      joined by videoconference). He shared his idea, and the reasons for it. He
      asked everyone to contact him personally after the meeting with any
      questions, concerns, comments, and advice on his plans.
  - topic: Dismissal
    title: Dismissals can be initiated by any individual, using the conflict
      resolution process if needed.
    content: >-
      At [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/), the process is almost
      identical to the one used at
      [Buurtzorg](http://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/), except that it is
      initiated by an individual rather than a team. Morning Star views a
      dismissal as the final step in a conflict and therefore uses its [conflict
      resolution](../conflict-resolution/) mechanism to deal with the situation.
      The process starts when one person asks another to leave the organization.
      Suppose that someone finds that a colleague has fundamentally breached a
      company value (perhaps the person made an important decision without
      requesting [advice ](../decision-making/)from colleagues) or that a
      colleague is failing time after time to live up to his
      [commitments](../commitment-working-hours-and-flexibility/), despite a
      number of previous attempts to improve the situation. She can initiate a
      conflict resolution process, asking her colleague to resign. If the person
      asked to leave does not agree, a four-stage conflict resolution process
      begins:


      In a first phase, they sit together and try to sort it out. In the discussion, the person asked to leave can suggest ways to restore trust. Or perhaps he will come to see that he has irrevocably lost the trust of his colleagues and that he is better off looking for work elsewhere.

      If they can’t agree on an outcome, another colleague is called in as a mediator.

      If necessary, in a third step, a panel of colleagues is asked to mediate.

      As a last resort, Chris Rufer, the founder and president, is asked to join the panel.

      People asked to mediate or sit on a panel take their role very seriously. Morning Star’s principle of not using force against anyone is at stake. They are not a jury, passing a verdict on a colleague. Their role is to explore every possible way to restore trust in the relationship. The process can take a long time if needed. Only when the person who has been asked to leave sees that colleagues genuinely tried to find a solution and that none could be found, will he come to accept that resignation is the reasonable outcome. Therein lies the power and legitimacy of the process.


      Because Morning Star views a dismissal as a private conflict between two persons, everyone is under the understanding of full confidentiality (as is always the case with the conflict resolution mechanism). As a result, no data exist of how often this happens. . Some more senior employees report that they have been part of a handful of panels over the years. They are advocates for the method. The panel discussions are never easy they report, but they do help people reach fair and reasonable outcomes^[Source: Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), pages 128-129].
