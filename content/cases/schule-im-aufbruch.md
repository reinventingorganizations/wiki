    content: '"Schule im Aufbruch" (in English, “Schools on the Move”) is a
      non-profit organization with 6 employees based in Berlin, Germany and
      founded in 2012. The idea of the three founders was that their purpose was
      to give people in and around schools clear instruction on how to change
      and in what to change in such a way that students could realize their full
      potential. As a regular part of their discussions, the employees have a
      chair that´s called "Schule im Aufbruch", and they ask it "what do you
      need?" or sit on it, when they are unsure. Over time, the purpose of
      Schule Im Aufbruch has evolved, and now includes helping motivated schools
      realize their potential as a whole and in their own unique ways as well as
      realizing the full potential of the Schule im Aufbruch employees.^[Monia
