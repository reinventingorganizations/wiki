    title: People self-set their salaries based on 4 simple questions
    content: >-
      At Elbdudler, colleagues self-set their salaries using the 4 following
      questions to trigger reflection and self-calibrate:


      * What do I need?

      * What's my market value outside of Elbdudler?

      * How much do my colleagues earn?

      * What can the company afford to pay?


      All salary choices are public. So far, no one has ever made an outrageous choice. If someone asks for a very high salary, colleagues can ask him or her to make a proposal how the company could earn more money. It's up to that person to make the plan happen ^[[http://www.mopo.de/geld/deutschlands-coolster-chef-er-laesst-mitarbeiter-selbst--ueber-ihr-gehalt-bestimmen,5066776,29007608.html](https://www.mopo.de/news/politik-wirtschaft/geld/deutschlands-coolster-chef-er-laesst-mitarbeiter-selbst--ueber-ihr-gehalt-bestimmen-282620)]
