      塔米·西蒙是桑楚的创始人，她发现精神实践帮助她发展了直觉能力，并认为这对她的事业很有帮助：


      塔米说，“直觉基本上就是我的全部存在。”她跟随一位名叫雷吉·雷的冥想老师学习。雷吉从自己的老师哪里学会如何“阅读征兆”，并把这些教导传给了塔米。“这是一种艺术形式，也是一种天赋的生存技能。如果你在打猎，你会注意那些痕迹。我们就是这样挑选项目的。我们看直觉带来的征兆。有多少人在谈论它？对于一个特定的作者，我们有多少个请求？我们对这个项目的内心感受是什么？这一点也很重要，公司内部问题也会通过“觉察征兆”来发现。…塔米发现有一个练习对激发灵感很有用，那就是视觉化练习。她描述了这个过程：“你想象自己进入地球的中心，进入水中，并把它们带到地表。于是，新的想法就会神奇出现。视觉化使健谈的头脑平静下来，并为愿景信息的浮现创造了呈现空间。”^\[ Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

    title: 情绪管理  在桑楚，组织中的成员对促进整体性的活动提出了两个想法。这些可以打造一种快乐、信任、完整和兴奋的情绪。这些活动被称为“艺术沙龙”和“睡衣日”。目前已成为年度活动。
    content: >-
      五年前，桑楚的一位同事在一个星期五下午组织了一次“艺术沙龙”。邀请每个人参加，与同事分享艺术激情。整个办公室的墙上都挂满了照片和画。


      搭建了一个用语表演的小舞台。一些人选择唱歌（一些关于公司生活的歌曲特别流行），另一些人则选择玩杂耍或跳舞。这活动如此受欢迎，乃至沙龙已经成为一个年度活动。公司创始人塔米·西蒙（Tami Simon）没有参与或指导创办第一家沙龙。但她看到，沙龙已经成为公司文化中的一个重要元素：“我意识到这些活动是在对人们说，‘你要成为一个完整的人。你的某些部分，可能不适合每天作为工作的一部分来表达。……但你现在能玩五个球的事实，其实很酷。在一个星期五下午，我们想坐下来喝杯酒，看着你这样做，承认并颂扬你人性的这个部分。”


      另一个是，有人建议把“睡衣日”作为庆祝春天到来的节日，现在已经快要遗忘了当时的起因。每个想加入的人都会穿着睡衣在办公室分享早餐。出现在集体早餐的几个成员得很开心，于是他们决定，在一天剩下的时间里继续穿着睡衣上班。


      从那时起，这项活动每年都举行。现在，当天会有90%的员工穿着睡衣出现，最佳服装还能获得奖励。（主人和狗的配套睡衣分享过一次奖品。）


      这个活动已经成为成员期待并提前准备的一个活动。“睡衣日”以其独特的方式讲述了一个故事——每一件睡衣都代表着一个故事，等待着对穿睡衣的人说些什么：是什么让你选择了那套衣服？


      当每个人都穿着滑稽的睡衣在办公室里闲逛时，再戴上职业面具显然更难。

    title: "Tami Simon, the founder of Sounds True, tells the following story about
      its particular culture and how people may or may not fit in:"
    content: >-
      One of the things I’ve found out at [Sounds
      True](https://www.soundstrue.com/) is in the first three months of
      employment a lot of the people don’t stay. … Sounds True, people want to
      get to know who you are, they want you to be real, they don’t want you to
      wear forty masks to work. It’s like―will the real person please stand up?
      There is this sense of authenticity; who we are when we are not at work is
      who we are when we are at work. That’s the kind of environment that’s here
      and of course we try to screen for this and let people know before they
      take the job, and a lot of people go “Oh I’m totally ready for that.  I’m
      interested in that, that’s what I want.”  But then they come in and may or
      may not be comfortable actually working in that kind of environment where
      people when they stop in the hallway and ask “How are you doing?” actually
      mean it! "How 'are' you doing?".

    title: "Sounds True has a three step appraisal process that turns an appraisal
      discussion into an experience of genuine inquiry and celebration. "
    content: >-
      [Sounds True](https://www.soundstrue.com/) has a three step appraisal
      process:


      * In phase 1, employees reflect on their performance and aspirations based on a list of questions to trigger thinking.

      * In phase 2, the practice starts with a minute of silence where colleagues are asked to hold the person receiving feedback in their hearts and try to let go of any form of judgement. Then, in turn, each person sits in front of their colleague and talks openly about what they most value in their colleague and reflect on one area where they think they could grow.

      * Finally in phase 3, the employee and a colleague reflect on the feedback through a deeper conversation to learn and decide what happens next.


      Feedback about how individuals can improve is given in the natural course of events throughout the year and not saved up for the annual appraisal.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 183]

    title: An example of outside investors compatible with Teal
    content: "Through careful selection of investors, Tami Simon has been able to
      bring in outside equity capital without sacrificing the company’s
      commitment to Teal practices and to multiple bottom lines. These investors
      are considered to be one of its key stakeholders: “We are committed to
      growing the long-term value of the business through careful planning and
      re-investing our profits into innovation and
      growth.”^[<http://www.soundstrue.com/store/about-us/core-values>]"

      In the early days, Tami Simon, the founder and CEO of
      <http://www.soundstrue.com> Sounds True, brought her dog along to the
      office. When the business expanded and employees were hired, it didn’t
      take long for some of them to ask if they too could bring their dogs to
      work. Tami couldn’t think of a reason to refuse. Today it is not rare for
      a meeting to take place with two or three dogs lying at people’s feet.
      Something special happens within the presence of dogs, colleagues noticed.
      Animals tend to ground us, to bring out the better sides of our nature.
      The simple practice of petting a dog tends to soothe us, to reconnect us
      to our body, and to calm down our spinning minds. And when it’s a
      colleague’s dog we pet, or a colleague that pets ours, we subtly build
      community. People found that the decision to open the company’s doors
      didn’t only allow in dogs, but more human life as well.^\[Laloux, Frederic

      A number of years ago, a colleague at Sounds True took it upon herself to organize an “Art Salon” on a Friday afternoon. Everyone was invited to share some artistic passion with his or her colleagues. Walls throughout the office were filled with photographs and paintings. A small stage was erected for people to perform. Some colleagues chose to sing (some songs composed about life in the company were particular hits), others juggled or danced tango. People enjoyed themselves so much that the salon has turned into an annual event. Tami wasn’t involved in setting up the first salon, but she sees that it has become an important element in the company culture:


      *I realized these events are saying to people, “You get to be a whole person. This part of you, it may not fit to do it as part of your job every day. … But the fact that you can now juggle five balls is actually cool. And on a Friday afternoon, we want to sit back and have a glass of wine and watch you do this and acknowledge this part of you.” That is part of what I think makes people feel \[that that] the wholeness of who they are is actually welcome. Because we do welcome it, we want to see it.*^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

    content: >-
      For Tami Simon, founder of Sounds True, purpose came before business:


      > *I’m kind of a strange person in a certain way. I dropped out of college because I didn’t feel like I actually could be myself in an academic environment. … I felt that in the academic environment I was being asked to pose as somebody who had answers to questions when instead I had experiences that I wanted to explore more deeply. … I went into a deep internal process where I prayed extremely hard and the prayer had to do with being of service. … The way I was thinking as a 20-, 21-year-old college dropout was, “Could I please be given the opportunity to take the talents that I have and all the gifts that I have been given by a very supporting and loving family and terrific opportunities for higher education … and give back in some way?” … The prayer was, “God, I’m willing to do your work. Please show me what it is. Please just show me what it is.”*

      >

      > *This phrase “willing to do your work” was very important to me because I didn’t want to be willful. I didn’t want to insist that it had to go my way. At the same time I didn’t want to be will-less where I was simply waiting in a coffee shop to be discovered. …*

      >

      > *I feel like Sounds True, this business, came to me as a 21-, 22-year-old as a gift and as a kind of covenant with the universe, a kind of bond where I said, “I’ll serve you. I’ll work really hard,” and the other side of it was, “You’ll be supported, you’ll be shown, doors will open, you’ll meet the people, opportunities will happen.” It’s this sense of a cosmic agreement that … I could help distribute spiritual teachings from different wisdom traditions from around the world. And I could do it with sincerity and devotion. That was my outlook from the beginning. It was never really about me per se. I wanted to be myself, I wanted to be authentic, and I wanted to make a contribution.^\[Tami Simon, interviewed by Diederick Janse and Ewan Townhead, podcast series “Waking up the Workplace,” episode “Even Sages need a Business Plan,” April 14, 2011.]*
