  - topic: Meetings
    title: HolacracyOne has created an effective set of meetings serving a specific
      purpose
    content: >-
      In Holacracy there are 4 meeting types:


      All meetings start with a 'check-in" and close with a 'check-out'.


      Tactical meetings:  These short daily or weekly meetings serve the operational process. Here work is coordinated. Operational processes are addressed, actions decided, and things get done. 


      Strategic meetings:  These rare meetings have no specific form and process thinking about how to best serve the [evolutionary purpose.](../evolutionary-purpose/)


      Special topic meetings:   Held when a topic calls for special attention. These meetings also have no specific form.


      Governance meetings:  These meetings are restricted to roles, and collaboration; not the rough and tumble of getting work done. The latter are for tactical meetings.  Governance meetings are held generally every month. They follow strict process to ensure everybone’s voice is heard and that no one can dominate [decision-making](../decision-making/). A facilitator guides the proceeding via the following process:


      1. Present proposal

      2. Clarifying questions

      3. Reaction round

      4. Amend and clarify

      5. Objection round

      6. Integration


      The process might sound formal and needs to get used to, but people who use it report they find it deeply liberating and dramatically efficient.
  - topic: Coordination
    title: HolocracyOne has set-up a company-wide Role Market Place to help
      coordinate workload
    content: >-
      [HolacracyOne ](https://www.holacracy.org/holacracyone/about)has set up a
      company-wide Role Marketplace in order to make trading roles easy. On the
      company’s intranet is a file where colleagues can “rate” every role they
      currently fill, using a scale of -3 to +3:


      * If they find the role energizing (+) or draining (-). 

      * If they find their talents aligned (+) or not (-) with this role. 

      * If they find their current skills and knowledge conducive to (+) or limiting in (-) this role.


      Using the same scale of -3 to +3, people can also signal their interest in roles currently filled by other people. The marketplace thus helps people wanting to offload or pick up roles.
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Team members qualify candidates based on fit for organization, purpose
      and role.
    content: >-
      [HolacracyOne](http://www.holacracyone.com/) is a training, consulting,
      and research company dedicated to spreading a new organizational model,
      “holcacray”, originally developed by Brian Robertson and his team at
      Ternary Software, a Philadelphia-based start-up. After transferring
      Ternary to new leadership, Robertson co-founded HolacracyOne.


      During the recruitment process, teammates check if


      * the person is “fit for organization” i.e. Is this person in resonance and energized by the evolutionary purpose, intrinsically motivated and comfortable with complex ever changing environment.

      * If yes, they check if the candidate is “fit for role”.
  - topic: Role Definition and Allocation
    title: An internal "Role Market place" to help in trading roles
    content: >-
      HolacracyOne has set up a company-wide Role Market Place in order to make
      trading roles easy (in holacratic language, this is an “app;” it’s not
      part of the basic operating system). On the company’s intranet is a file
      where colleagues can “rate” every role they currently fill, using a scale
      of -3 to +3:


      * If they find the role energizing (+) or draining (-).

      * If they find their talents aligned (+) or not (-) with this role.

      * If they find their current skills and knowledge conducive to (+) or limiting in (-) this role.


      Using the same scale of -3 to +3, people can also signal their interest in roles currently filled by other people. The market place helps people wanting to offload or pick up roles.
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: HolacracyOne uses a regular meeting practice for colleagues to share and
      discuss commitment.
    content: During these meetings, colleagues discuss how much time and energy, at
      that moment in their lives, they want to commit to the organization’s
      purpose. The rationale behind this regular meeting is for each person to
      make a conscious choice about how much time and energy they are willing to
      commit. At the same time, the meeting practice gives all colleagues a
      conscious way of holding and recognizing that as humans, everyone has
      multiple endeavors that interest and enliven them, and that each person is
      choosing how much time and energy they want to give to any particular
      purpose^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker
      (2014), page 182].
  - topic: Compensation and incentives
    title: "HolacracyOne, the small consultancy/training company behind Holacracy,
      uses a ranking mechanism, which feeds an algorithm that allocates
      colleagues to salary bands. "
    content: >-
      Once a year, colleagues at HolacracyOne fill out a survey for all their
      colleagues, consisting of only two questions:


      * “This person contributes (much) more or (much) less than me.” (On a scale of -3 to +3)

      * “This person has a good basis to evaluate me.” (On a scale of 1 to 5)


      A simple algorithm crunches through the answers and groups colleagues into a few salary buckets. The more experienced, knowledgeable, and hard-working people land in the higher buckets that earn bigger salaries; the more junior, less experienced colleagues naturally gravitate toward buckets with lower salaries.^[Interview Frederic Laloux with Tom Thomison, 2013]
