introduction: |-
  Camif was founded in 1947. After going bankrupt in 2008, it
  was taken over and reinvented by its new main owner and
  CEO Emery Jacquillat. It is now a company that sells
  exclusively online and has focused on furniture, bedding, and
  "made in France" products ( for over 70% of its revenue).

    title: The real richness of a company is its capacity to create links
    content: |-
      One of the 3 AAA values displayed by the company is
      **Attention** (Audacity and Agility are the other two).
      The proposed personal attitude suggested for employees is to
      take care of oneself, to create links with others and to be
      open to the world.
      Camif pays special attention to its ecosystem. It announces
      its mission (co-created with its stakeholders) as *“to offer
      products and services for the home, for the benefit of
      humanity and the planet. Mobilizing its ecosystem,
      collaborating and acting to invent new models of
      consumption, production and organization.”*

      The ecosystem consists of its consumers, employees,
      suppliers, shareholders, local stakeholders.
      Thereby, to imagine the interior space of the future, they
      created a unique event, the « Camifathlon ». For 2 days, they
      gathered a part of their ecosystem such as experts, suppliers,
      designers or customers to co-create Camif’s collections for
      the coming years.

      Each year, the free online Camif Tour allows participants to
      discover the backstage of French manufacturing, to promote
      exchanges and to create links with the manufacturers in the
      regions.

    title: "\"It's up to me to invent the future\""
    content: >-
      After the buyout and merger of Camif in 2009, the CEO knew

      that moving towards more collaboration among the teams

      would require a change in culture, and that this would be

      something taking a lot of time.

      To create links and encourage innovation, Camif has hosted

      an artist in residence for three months. Struck by the fact that

      the employees exchanged emails in the open space instead

      of talking to each other, she started by marking the spots of

      real exchanges with pink strips on the floor. The less talkative

      ones quickly understood that they lacked interactivity.

      Then she made use of the parking lot and renamed the

      spaces with the names of her favorite artists. Every morning,

      employees discovered new painters or sculptors while

      parking and talked about them among themselves.

      The teams were shaken up but were also quickly bonded by

      the dialogue and the link created by these creations.

      Moreover, it was no longer a question of rehashing the past

      with things like “before, we did it like that". 


      CAMIF became "C'est A Moi d'Inventer le Futur" ("It's up to me to invent the

      future“).
