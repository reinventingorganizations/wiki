    title: At BerylHealth an e-mail sent to the whole workforce recognizing and

      “Good Stuff Friday” for everyone.
    content: >-
      [BerylHealth](http://www.berylhealth.com/) has come up with a variation of
      the [ESBZ's ](http://www.ev-schule-zentrum.de/aktuell/)practice. But
      instead of gathering together, a mass email chain always erupts at some
      point on Friday afternoon. (Hence the name the practice has taken: “Good
      Stuff Friday”.).


      One colleague sends an email to the entire workforce recognizing and thanking another colleague or department for something that happened that week, or simply to share some good news.


      The first email invariably triggers a whole avalanche of thanking and recognition. This practice builds community and closes the week in a spirit of appreciation and gratitude.
