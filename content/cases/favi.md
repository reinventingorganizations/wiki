    title: Sending love to clients
    content: "Through a process of collective discussion, FAVI’s employees
      determined the organization had two reasons for existence, two fundamental
      purposes: the first to provide meaningful work in the area of Hallencourt,
      a rural area in northern France where good work is rare; the second to
      give and receive love from clients. Yes, love, a word rarely heard in the
      world of business, and even more unexpected in a blue-collar manufacturing
      environment. At FAVI, it has taken on real meaning. Operators don’t just
      send products to their clients, they send products into which they have
      put their heart. A few years ago, around Christmas time, an operator at
      FAVI molded excess brass into a few small figurines of Santa and of
      reindeers. He added the figurines into the boxes of finished products,
      rather like kids put a message in a bottle they throw out to sea,
      imagining that someone, somewhere, would find it. Other operators have
      since picked up on the idea and at random times of the year add brass
      figurines into their shipments, as little tokens of love to their
      counterparts working on assembly lines at Volkswagen or Volvo, who will
      find the figurines when they unpack the boxes.^\\[Laloux, Frederic

  - topic: Organizational Structure
    title: FAVI employs a customer-based parallel team structure with supporting teams
    content: "FAVI’s factory has more than 500 employees that are organized in 21
      teams called “mini-factories” of 15 to 35 people. Most of the teams are
      dedicated to a specific customer or customer type (the Volkswagen team,
      the Audi team, the Volvo team, and so forth). There are a few upstream
      production teams (the foundry team, the mold repair team, maintenance),
      and support teams (engineering, quality, lab, administration, and sales
      support). Each team self-organizes; there is no middle management, and
      there are virtually no rules or procedures other than those that the teams
      decide upon themselves. The staff functions have nearly all disappeared.
      The former HR, planning, scheduling, engineering, production-IT and
      purchasing departments have all been shut down. Their tasks have been
      taken over by the operators in the teams, who do their own hiring,
      purchasing, planning, and scheduling. The sales department has been
      disbanded too. The sales account manager for Audi is now part of the Audi
      team, just as the sales account manager for Volvo is part of the Volvo
      team. There is no head of sales above the group of account managers. In
      the old structure, white-collar workers in offices with windows
      overlooking the shop floor planned in detail what the workers needed to
      do, by when, and how. Now blue-collar workers effectively wear their own
      white collars and no longer receive instructions from above.^[Laloux,

  - topic: Coordination
    title: At FAVI, coordination happens organically on a voluntary basis through
      regular meetings, temporary project teams and reverse delegation.
    content: "At FAVI, production is organized by customer. This makes
      load-balancing a significant issue: because customer orders fluctuate, on
      any given day some teams might have too much work and others too little.
      Rather than employing a COO or staff planner to make decisions about
      allocating work across teams, FAVI chose a more organic and elegant
      solution. At regular intervals, a group composed of one designated person
      from each team comes together for a few minutes; they quickly discuss
      which teams are over or understaffed; back in their teams, they ask for
      volunteers to switch teams for a shift or two. The person from the Audi
      team, for example, might ask who in the team is willing to spend the day
      with the Volvo team. Things happen organically on a voluntary basis;
      nobody is being allocated to a team by a higher authority.^[Laloux,

  - topic: Information Flow
    title: Information flow in time of crisis.
    content: >-
      When Jean-Francois Zobrist, the CEO of [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), was
      faced with difficult and critical decisions at the company, he readily
      admitted he needed help to find a good answer. More than once, on impulse,
      he went around the shop floor, asked everybody to stop the machines,
      climbed on a soapbox and shared his problem with all employees, trying to
      figure out a course of action.


      In time of crisis, he openly shared information with all employees about the reality of the situation, trusting them to handle it. As a result, employees did not retain a false sense of safety. Everybody, regardless of any rank, could take the opportunity to sense the impact of the information offered and resonate to it. People in the audience shouted questions and proposals. Together they found a collective course of action to overcome the crisis.
  - topic: Meetings
    title: A rhythm of meetings to suit manufacturing.
    content: >-
      Weekly senior management meetings in [Favi](http://www.favi.com/) used to
      include the heads of sales, production, maintenance, finance, HR, etc.
      These are now held at the team level.  


      Teams hold short regular meetings to align and make decisions as follows:


      * a short tactical discussion at the start of every shift

      * a weekly meeting with the sales account manager to discuss orders

      * a monthly meeting with an open agenda


      Beyond that, they tend to have no regularly scheduled meetings at all. If cross-team meetings occur, it’s in response to a specific need.
  - topic: Mood Management
    title: "FAVI had a beautiful practice of gratitude and celebration: every
      meeting in the company started with a round where each participant in turn
      shared a brief story of someone they had recently thanked or
      congratulated."
    content: "This powerful practice start of the meeting at [FAVI
      ](http://www.favi.com/)had a telling effect on meetings: it nourished
      moods of possibility, gratitude, celebration, and trust. Focusing on
      others and their accomplishments shifts focus away from the personal
      preoccupations members might have brought to the meeting. After a few
      years, this practice started feeling staid to people at
      [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), and was dropped. It might show up again,
      perhaps in another form. Such practices evolve. They should feel fresh and
      meaningful, not formal and fixed."
  - topic: Recruitment
    title: Uses an extended trial period, to ensure a mutual match.
    content: "[FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) made extended use of the trial period for
      both parties to test whether the match works out."
  - topic: Onboarding
    title: FAVI newly hired engineers and administrative workers are trained at
      operating at least one machine on the shop floor.  New hires also end
      their onboarding process writing a free format open letter to the group of
      colleagues they have joined, frequently expressing joy and gratitude.
    content: >-
      At [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), the French automotive supplier, all
      engineers and administrative workers have been trained to operate at least
      one machine on the shop floor. The training is regularly put to good use:
      when orders must be rushed out, it happens that all hands get called on
      deck. White-collar workers come down from the office space on the first
      floor to man the machines for a few hours. It’s a wonderful
      community-building practice. People in engineering and administrative
      roles work under the guidance of the machine operators. They witness
      first-hand how hard the work on the machines can be and how much skill it
      involves. At the end of the day, when the orders are out on time,
      colleagues share a sense of pride in the work accomplisheɖ.


      [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/)’s onboarding process ends on a nice touch. New teammates who have gone through all the training modules of the first two months are asked to write an open letter to the group of colleagues they have joined. There are no instructions on what the letter should be about, so new hires often dig deep in their selfhood to find something worthwhile to say. The letters are, time and again, deeply touching accounts of gratitude and joy. Many blue-collar workers join [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) scarred from past experience of mistrust and command and control. Joining an environment where they are considered trustworthy and where their voice counts is often a groundbreaking experience. For many machine operators, writing is not their preferred style of expression. Finding the right words for the letter can take a lot of effort, and the practice is akin to a ritual, a rite of passage into the community.
  - topic: Training and Coaching
    title: At FAVI, all engineers and administrative workers have been trained to
      operate at least one machine on the shop floor. This training is put to
      good use when orders must be rushed out. All hands are called on deck.
      White-collar workers come from their office space to man the machines for
      a few hours.
    content: "It’s a wonderful community-building practice. People from engineering

      When the orders are shipped on time, colleagues share a sense of pride in
      the accomplishment.\r

      \r

      FAVI also has a training program given to new members. But one
      session, only, may insufficient for someone to unlearn old habits and pick
      up new ones. The initial training modules are therefore expanded with
      follow-up training and workshops interwoven into daily life. The CEO,
      Jean- François Zobrist, used to chair a one-hour session every Friday
      morning, open to whoever wanted to join. The topic: An in-depth look at
      one of FAVI’s core organizational tools. (FAVI calls them fiches, or index
      cards, as they are literally available in the form of index cards to
      employees.) These include organization purpose, values, decision-making
      mechanisms, and lean manufacturing techniques. "
  - topic: Commitment, Working Hours and Flexibility
    title: At Favi, no one clocks in and out but workers still work in shift
      patterns and are expected to spend roughly this time on the shop floor.
    content: An operator at [Favi](http://www.favi.com/) who was having a house
      built, brought the topic up with his team. To be on site with the
      builders, he wanted to switch to the night shift. He asked if a colleague
      would be willing to swap shifts for a four month period. An arrangement
      was quickly found without the need for a formal HR approval process of
      management approval^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson
      Parker (2014), page 183].
  - topic: Job Titles and Job Descriptions
    title: A worker at FAVI might operate a number of different machines, be in
      charge of ordering supplies for his team, lead a number of continuous
      improvement actions, and be responsible for recruitment to his team.
      Except perhaps for recruitment purposes, no one bothers to write down a
      job description.
    content: "However, at [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), one person on the team holds
      most management roles for the team ([FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) calls
      them, rather unhelpfully, a “team leader”, which might imply hierarchical
      power over their colleagues). FAVI found it works best to have one person
      free to roam among the team and only operate a machine occasionally when a
      helping hand is needed. FAVI’s team leaders act as coaches for their
      colleagues, as a clearinghouse for information, and as a point person when
      coordination is needed with other teams. This choice nevertheless carries
      a risk. Our cultural baggage of hierarchy is so strong that over time,
      team leaders could start behaving like bosses and become the primary
      decision makers on their teams. At FAVI, a simple but powerful relief
      valve exists, should a team leader find the taste of power too sweet:
      workers can choose at any moment to join another team. Team leaders have
      no meaningful way of coercing people into desired behavior; they certainly
      don’t have the authority to fire people unilaterally. If they start to
      behave autocratically, people can simply walk away"
  - topic: Objectives and Target Setting
    title: Sales teams have no sales targets.
    content: >-
      At [Favi](http://www.favi.com/), sales account roles are part of the
      product team, for example the Audi team. No one gives them sales targets.
      Their motivation is to serve their clients well and, in the face of
      Chinese competition, to maintain and when possible increase the number of
      jobs the factory can provide. To account managers, feeding their team with
      work is a motivation far stronger than any sales target from a Head of
      Sales could ever provide. At Favi, sales orders are always discussed in
      terms of employment, not in monetary terms; so there is no "we got a
      million order" but rather "we got an order for 10 people's work". This is
      in line with the organization's purpose, which is to create jobs in an
      area where jobs are scarce.


      Incidentally, workers at Favi do not get production targets either. They are well aware of the impact China has on their market, given the feedback they receive from their sales account managers. Operators set themselves target times to machine their pieces, and they monitor their performance against that target.
  - topic: Innovation and Product Development
    title: FAVI invents the first method for molding 100 % pure copper - for
      challenge and beauty, with zero market research.
    content: >-
      In the 1990s, Zobrist (CEO) and a few colleagues at [FAVI
      ](http://www.favi.com/)became fascinated with the following idea:
      foundries always produce alloys, because pure copper cannot be molded.
      What if FAVI could somehow do the impossible - shape industrial products
      made of 100 percent pure copper? They started tinkering.


      Would there be a market for such products? They had no idea, but they didn't care to commission a market study. Pure copper has some properties, like electrical conductivity, that alloys don't have; such a property must have a purpose. What really got them excited was not the market they might discover. They were excited by the beauty of the seemingly impossible: to shape pure copper.


      After two years of tinkering, they succeeded. And as they had imagined, a market came knocking at their door. Pure copper rotors have interesting properties in electrical motors. This is now an important business for FAVI.^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 208]
  - topic: Innovation and Product Development
    title: FAVI invents a new antiseptic copper alloy for hospitals using aesthetics
      and intuition.
    content: >-
      Metallurgists have long known that copper has antiseptic properties. *It's
      a shame*, people at [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) thought, *that this
      property isn't put to use in products*. A team started tinkering with
      antimicrobial copper equipment for hospitals. A prototype soon gave
      promising results, but Zobrist (CEO) was bothered by its color. The
      reddish color of copper evokes the faded world of old 19th-century
      sanatoriums, he found.


      Zobrist (CEO) asked the project team if they could make a prototype with a silver-colored alloy, to give it the shine of stainless steel we associate with modern equipment. The team scoffed: This simply made no sense. The added material for the alloy would make the copper lose its antiseptic properties. Zobrist (CEO) knew he had no ground to stand on. But he was possessed by a deep aesthetic and intuitive sense that it was worth pursuing. He managed to persuade the team into giving it a try.


      To everybody's surprise, and for reasons still unclear, the silver-color alloy not only kept the copper's antiseptic properties, it enhanced them. A new market opened for FAVI.


      The product development process that FAVI used to achieve this breakthrough was developed in collaboration with a Japanese professor, Shoji Shiba. It is a design process that explicitly factors in emotions, beauty and intuition^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 209]
  - topic: Purchasing and Investments
    title: FAVI implemented a practice of bottom-up planning based on trust towards
      its teams to come up with realistic budget requests. In case of conflicts,
      representatives of each team sort out problems on their own.
    content: >-
      Once a year, every team at [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) establishes the
      investment budget for the next year - new machines, new tooling, and so
      on. In most organizations, the finance department challenges these
      requests and ultimately the executive committee or the CEO arbitrates
      across departments to channel more money in one direction or another. This
      opens up the can of worms of politics. Everyone jockeys for a bigger part
      of the pie. For middle managers, the size of the budget is often the
      yardstick by which their status is measured. They try, as best as they
      can, to influence the decision makers in the executive committee through
      any formal and informal channels at their disposal.


      At FAVI, there are no middle managers that fight for budgets, and their CEO Jean-Francois Zobrist refused to play the role of the father who would decide how to divide up the candy among his children. Teams know that no haggling will take place, so they don’t throw in inflated numbers to start with; they make realistic requests based on realistic needs. In most years, when the budgets of the teams are added up, the resulting number is reasonable, and all plans get the green light, with neither discussion nor scrutiny. Teams are trusted to do the right thing; if one team were to get itself golden-plated machines, other teams would quickly notice, and peer-pressure would self-regulate the problem away. In those years where the combined projects exceed what would be reasonable, the CEO simply asks teams to sit together and to come back to him with a revised plan. Representatives from each team come together and put all the plans on a table. They look at what is most important and what might be deferred in everyone’s plans. In one or two meetings, the problem is always sorted out.


      Like other roles, the traditional purchasing and investments tasks of a manager - budgeting, planning, and controlling - are scattered among various members of a team. A worker at [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), might operate a number of different machines, be in charge of ordering supplies for his team, lead a number of continuous improvement actions, and be responsible for recruitment to his team^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 77-79 and following]
  - topic: Budgeting and Controlling
    title: FAVI implemented a practice of bottom-up planning based on trust towards
      its teams to come up with realistic budget requests.  In case of
      conflicts, representatives of each team sort out problems on their own.
    content: >-
      The traditional practice in organizations, says FAVI, is to look five
      years ahead and make plans for the next year. FAVI believes we should
      think like farmers; look 20 years ahead, and plan only for the next day.
      One must look far out to decide which fruit trees to plant or which crops
      to grow. But it makes no sense to plan at the beginning of the year the
      precise date for harvest. As hard as we try, we cannot control the
      weather, the crops, or the soil. They all have a life of their own beyond
      our control. A farmer who would stick rigidly to plan, instead of sensing
      and adjusting to reality, would quickly grow hungry.


      FAVI finds it needs a basic budget to help make certain decisions. Once a year, every operating team (FAVI is organized by client teams, e.g., the Volkswagen team, the Volvo team, etc, and by support teams, e.g., the foundry team, the maintenance team, etc.) makes a monthly forecast for the year to come of sales and costs. The numbers are added up, and whatever the result, it is considered the budget for FAVI overall. That budget can then be used to inform decision making, for instance, to determine the expected tonnage of metal that will be bought for which a supply contract must be secured.


      The budget is not used to track mostly performance: there is no monthly comparison of actuals vs budget. Teams simply track their monthly numbers and if the numbers are unsatisfactory (as compared to the previous month or year, or to some ratio) they discuss corrective action. In its management manifesto, FAVI captures the thinking about budgets in a provocative statement; “*In the new way of thinking, we aim to make money without knowing how we do it, as opposed to the old way of losing money knowing exactly how we lose it*.” FAVI is privately owned and doesn’t need to report to outside shareholders.
  - topic: Crisis Management
    title: CEO of FAVI, Jean-Francois Zobrist asks everyone on the shop floor for
      help in the wake of the first Gulf War.
    content: "It was a common occurrence, that when faced with difficult and
      critical decisions at FAVI, Zobrist would readily admit he needed help to
      find a good answer. On impulse, he would go around the shop floor and ask
      everyone to stop machines, and he would climb on a soapbox and share the
      problem with all the employees, trying to figure the course of action. The
      first major crisis under his leadership occurred in 1990 when car orders
      plummeted in the wake of the first Gulf War. Stocks were piling up, and
      there simply wasn't enough work to keep workers busy. Capacity and costs
      needed to be reduced.\r

      \r

      There was one obvious solution: fire the temp workers. But at FAVI,
      no one was really considered a temp worker. For reasons related to labor
      laws in France, new recruits were hired as temp workers for 18 months
      before they were offered a full contract. Most of them were already
      considered full members of their teams. By firing the temps, FAVI would
      rescind its moral commitment to them, and it would lose talent it had
      invested in, with a recovery perhaps only a few months away. With many
      questions and no clear answers, Zobrist found himself on the soapbox and
      shared his dilemma with all employees in that shift (including the temp
      workers whose fate was being discussed). People in the audience shouted
      questions and proposals. One worker said, \"This month, why don't we all
      work only three weeks and get three weeks' pay, and we keep the temp
      workers? If we need to we will do the same thing next month as well.\"
      Heads nodded, and the proposal was put to a vote.\r

      \r

      To Zobrist's surprise, there was unanimous agreement. Workers had
      just agreed to a temporary 25 percent salary cut. In less than an hour,
      the problem was solved and machine noise reverberated around the factory
      again. Zobrist’s ability to keep his fear in check paved the way for a
      radically more productive and empowering approach and showed that it is
      possible to confront employees with a harsh problem and let them
      self-organize their way out of it."
  - topic: Fundamental Assumptions
    title: Leader Jean François Zobrist analyzed the organization chart of the
      traditionally run factory in the 1980's. Together with his colleagues, he
      made explicit the underlying assumptions about men and women in the
      organization. Then they defined three new assumptions, that over time have
      become mantras inside the factory.
    content: >-
      At FAVI in the 1980's, regarding the organizational practices, men and
      women were considered to be :


      * **Thieves**, because everything was locked up in storage rooms.

      * **Lazy**, as their working time was controlled and every late showing punished by somebody (who didn't care to inquire about the reasons for being late).

      * **Not dependable,** because all their production was controlled by somebody else – who must not have been very dependable either because general control mechanisms had been put in place.

      * **Not intelligent**, as a "manufacturing engineering" department did the thinking for them.


      Here are the new assumptions :


      * People are systematically considered to be good (reliable, self-motivated, trustworthy, intelligent).

      * There is no performance without happiness. To be happy, we need to be responsible. To be responsible, we must understand why and for whom we work, and be free to decide how.

      * Value is created on the shop floor. Shop floor operators craft the products, the CEO and staff at best serve to support them. At worst, they are costly distractions.
  - topic: Self-Management
    title: A competitive global supplier run without middle management
    content: "FAVI’s factory has more than 500 employees that are organized in 21
      teams called “mini-factories” of 15 to 35 people. Most of the teams are
      dedicated to a specific customer or customer type (the Volkswagen team,
      the Audi team, the Volvo team, the water meter team, and so forth). There
      are a few upstream production teams (the foundry team, the mold repair
      team, maintenance), and support teams (engineering, quality, lab,
      administration, and sales support). Each team self-organizes; there is no
      middle management, and there are virtually no rules or procedures other
      than those that the teams decide upon themselves.^[Laloux, Frederic

  - topic: Listening to Purpose
    title: soul searching prompted by a proposed order that came out of the blue
    content: "Early on in his tenure as CEO, Jean-François Zobrist invited all the
      factory employees to a meeting to figure out the organization’s raison
      d’être. The soul searching was prompted by a proposed order that came out
      of the blue from a French car manufacturer. Could they, within a year,
      supply not only a gear fork, but a full gearbox? This single order would
      be larger than all of FAVI’s existing business. Many people thought it was
      too risky. Zobrist felt the decision could not be made without inquiring
      into the purpose of the organization. In keeping with his style, he
      involved the whole company, in meetings with subgroups of 15 people at a
      time on Friday afternoons. He showed up at the meeting with no agenda and
      no process; he trusted that his colleagues would somehow self-organize in
      these meetings, reconvening every Friday if needed, until they had
      answered this most fundamental question: what is our purpose?\r

      \r

      After much discussion, when the obvious but superficial ideas had
      been discarded, the answer emerged with clarity. FAVI has two reasons for
      existence, two fundamental purposes: the first is to provide meaningful
      work in the area of Hallencourt, a rural area in northern France where
      good work is rare; the second is to give and receive love from clients.\r

      \r

      At FAVI, love, a word rarely heard in the world of business, has
      taken on real meaning. Operators don’t just send products to their
      clients, they send products into which they have put their heart. A few
      years ago, around Christmas time, an operator at FAVI molded excess brass
      into a few small figurines of Santa and of reindeers. He added the
      figurines into the boxes of finished products, rather like kids put a
      message in a bottle they throw out to sea, imagining that someone,
      somewhere, would find it. Other operators have since picked up on the idea
      and at random times of the year add brass figurines into their shipments,
      as little tokens of love to their counterparts working on assembly lines
      at Volkswagen or Volvo, who will find the figurines when they unpack the
      boxes. ^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide

  - topic: Dismissal
    title: A novel alternative to dismissal in a time of crisis
    content: "When CEO Jean-François Zobrist was faced with critical decisions, he
      readily looked to the workforce for help. More than once, on impulse, he
      went around the shop floor, asked everybody to stop the machines, climbed
      on a soapbox and shared his problem.\r

      \r

      His first major crisis happened in 1990 when orders plummeted in the
      wake of the First Gulf War. there simply wasn’t enough work to keep
      workers busy. Capacity and costs needed to be reduced. There was one
      obvious solution: fire the temp workers.\r

      \r

      But at FAVI, no one was really considered a temp worker. For reasons
      related to labor laws in France, new recruits were hired as temp workers
      for 18 months before being offered a full contract. Most were already
      considered full members of their teams. By firing them, FAVI would rescind
      its moral commitment to them, and it would lose talent it had invested in,
      with a recovery perhaps only a few months away.\r

      \r

      With no clear answers, Zobrist found himself on the soapbox and
      shared his dilemma with all employees (including the temp workers whose
      fate was being discussed). People shouted questions and proposals. One
      said, “This month, why don’t we all work only three weeks and get three
      weeks’ pay, and we keep the temp workers? If we need to, we will do the
      same thing next month as well.”\r

      \r

      Heads nodded, the proposal was put to a vote, and unanimously
      agreed. Workers just agreed to a temporary 25 percent salary cut. In less
      than an hour, the problem was solved and machine noise reverberated around
      the factory again.\r

      \r\n"
  - topic: Staff Functions
    title: At FAVI, almost all central staff functions have disappeared and been
      integrated into "mini-factories".
    content: "Today, FAVI has more than 500 employees who are organized into 21
      teams called “mini-factories” of 15 to 35 people. Most of the teams are
      dedicated to a specific customer or customer type (the Volkswagen team,
      the Audi team, the Volvo team, the water meter team, and so forth). There
      are a few upstream production teams (the foundry team, the mold repair
      team, maintenance), and support teams (engineering, quality, lab,
      administration, and sales support). Each team self-organizes; there is no
      middle management, and there are virtually no rules or procedures other
      than those that the teams decide upon themselves.\r

      \r

      The staff functions have nearly all disappeared. The former HR,
      planning, scheduling, engineering, production, IT and purchasing
      departments have all been shut down. Their tasks have been taken over by
      the operators in the teams, who do their own hiring, purchasing, planning,
      and scheduling.\r

      \r

      When opportunities arise that span the boundaries of several teams,
      FAVI workers self-nominate to create a temporary project team. Sometimes a
      person is appointed for a staff role to coordinate across teams, but that
      person receives no authority to impose decisions on the teams. For
      example, at FAVI there is Denis, an engineer, whose role is to help teams
      exchange insights and best practices. He spends his days encouraging
      machine operators to go and see what other teams have come up with. He
      can’t coerce a team into adopting another team’s ideas. He must get them
      interested and excited. If he fails to do so, if teams stop seeing added
      value in his work, then his role will naturally disappear, and Denis will
      need to find himself another role to fill. In the true sense of the word,
      he has a support function. This is highly unusual for manufacturing
      environments - an engineer who is in service to and not in command of
      less-educated (but highly skilled) blue-collar workers..^[Source: Laloux,
