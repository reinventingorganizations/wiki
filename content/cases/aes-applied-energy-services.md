    title: 通过建议流程，AES员工发起有关环境与社会责任的项目倡议。
    content: >-
      对于[AES](http://www.aes.com/)而言，环境和社会责任项目倡议源于内在正义感。以下是AES在向公众发行股票时，向美国证券交易委员会（SEC）提交的一份公开文件中的表述：“AES的一个重要因素是对四大‘共享’价值观的承诺^
      \[其中之一是社会责任，这触发了AES植树的决定]。如果公司意识到这些价值观和利润之间存在冲突，将努力坚持自己的价值观，即使这样做可能会导致利润减少或失去机会。此外，公司寻求坚持这些价值观，并不是为了取得经济成功，而是因为坚持本身，就是一个值得追求的目标。”


      AES种植了数百万棵树以抵消碳排放。这个想法来自洛杉矶的一名员工，而不是高层团队。起初没有预算。她通过建议流程，为AES需要投入到植树上的资金找到了赞助。^\[Source: Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), pages 160-172]

      AES最近聘请的一位财务分析师告诉首席执行官丹尼巴克，他打算离开自己目前的岗位，回到自己的祖国巴基斯坦，代表AES研究那里的发电领域的机会。巴克对此表示怀疑，他说，尽管几年前美国国务院鼓励我们向巴基斯坦扩展业务，但由于担心那里腐败严重，我们拒绝了这个建议。


      尽管首席执行官有这样的建议，但分析师还是决定去巴基斯坦，这实际上是为自己创造了一个新的职位。他成了业务开发人员，并保留以前的工资。六个月后，他邀请巴克到巴基斯坦会见总理。两年半后，一座耗资7亿美元的发电厂开始运转。^\[ Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

    title: AES在其专业领域为员工提供了高度的自主权，赋权给他们代表公司就数百万美元的工厂投资出去谈判。跨学科志愿工作队由总部少数具有相关专业知识的人员共同支撑，负责进行预算规划和审计。
    content: >-
      与[法维](http://www.favi.com/)和[S太阳液压](http://www.sunhydraulics/)类似，[AES](http://www.ase.com/)的基层团队，负责进行与日常运营所有方面相关的决策，包括投资相关预算、招聘、培训、评估、薪酬、资本支出和采购，以及长期战略和慈善捐赠。[AES公司](http://www.ase.com/)是一家能源供应商，经营火力和水力发电厂以及电网。这种设备对许多人和企业的生活至关重要。《华尔街日报》的记者亚历克斯•马克尔斯撰写的头版文章，用一个故事说明了[AES](http://www.ase.com/)
      的团队承担了多少通常由总部负责的职责：


      在康涅狄格州的蒙特维尔——杰夫·哈奇用那双还因为刚从驳船上卸煤而发黑的手，拿起电话，给他最喜欢的经纪人打过去。“30天1000万元，你能给我什么样的利率？他问这位经办国库券的代理人。“只有6.09？但我刚从大通那里得到6.13。”在另一个房间里，乔·奥多正在跟摩根大通交涉。“6.15，30天？”奥多先生证实说，自己只是AES公司发电厂的维修技术员。奥多和哈奇是一个管理着3300万美元工厂投资基金的特别小组的成员。然后，他们很快在与合伙人进行磋商之后，达成了那笔交易。…这听起来像是疯狂“授权”。在他们的专长领域给予员工更多的自主权？当然。打开员工权限的禁忌？也许。但是，如果把企业财务决策权交给那些集体借款经历只包括“抵押贷款、两辆车贷款和一些还清信用卡债务”的员工，又有什么好处呢？“有很多好处。”艾斯说。……该公司首席执行官、创始人之一丹尼斯•W•巴克认为：“成员的责任感越强，公司经营状况就越有可能得到逐步改善。”。“更重要的是，”他说，“这会让工作变得更有趣。”让煤炭管理者承担投资责任有风险吗？巴克先生认为没有风险。他指出，蒙特维尔的志愿者团队中有一名财务顾问，成员志愿者的投资选择范围被专家指导在很窄范围内。他们并不完全是在购买衍生品。首席执行官喜欢这种做法，是因为“成员被这种经历改变了。他们对企业的各个方面都有了更多的了解，他们对公司的感觉，永远不会是原来的样子。” ^\[Alex Markels, "Blank Check," The Wall Street Journal, April 9, 1998)]


      在AES，每个团队每年制定一次投资预算。一线工厂级的预算加起来，有时一年高达3亿美元。当基层团队对自己制定的工厂综合预算感到满意后，就交给预算工作组，跟所有其他工厂的预算一起，接受内容审查。该工作组将提出变更和改进建议（但无权强制实施变更）。该工作队的工作人员有些是来自总部的具有相关专业知识的人，但主要成员是来自基层团队的各种背景的成员——在这个工作组内，一名保安可以坐在一名技术人员和一名工程师的旁边。内部审计也以同样的方式，由志愿工作队进行：每个工厂预算都接受其他兄弟工厂同事的审计。


      AES发现，使用志愿工作队而不是固定的管理职能，有多重好处。让员工找到途径表达一些，在自己主要岗位角色上用不到的一些额外才能和天赋。当他们看到自己真正拥有了塑造公司的权力时，就会产生真正的主人翁意识和责任感。创始人丹尼斯·巴克克还坚持认为：这些特别工作组也是强大的学习机构。在任何时候，都会有成千上万的成员加入工作队，从更有经验的同事那里学习技术和领导技能。这是一种现代形式的大规模学徒制度。任何课堂培训都无法提供志愿工作队日复一日的学习量。^\[Laloux, Frederic.

    title: 建议流程需要暂停时，AES尽可能优雅的处理这种暂停
    content: >-
      2001年秋天，在恐怖袭击和安然公司倒闭之后，AES股价暴跌。该公司当时正需要进入资本市场，寻求对其高负债水平的弥补，但却发现资本市场突然关闭了。为了防止破产，必须采取迅速而艰难的行动。一个关键的问题是：为了筹集必要的资金，需要出售多少个发电厂，出售哪些发电厂？由于四万人分布在世界各地，首席执行官丹尼斯•巴克克很难像法维的佐布里斯特那样，站在肥皂盒上，召集所有人征求建议。问题是如此复杂，以至于他也不能像在布尔佐格的乔斯德布洛克那样，简单地发一篇博文，给出两个备选方案。


      巴克克选择的行动方案是，暂时中止建议流程。尽管如此，还是在处理中尽量减少暂停行动，给自我管理模式带来信任下降的风险。他没有与管理团队闭门制定计划；而是公开宣布，将在有限的时间内，针对有限的决策，制定一些自上而下（不遵循建议流程的）重要决策。并保证建议流程对此外的所有其他决策继续有效。为了调查最佳的行动方案并做出艰难的决定，贝克任命比尔·卢拉斯基负责决策，他是一位年轻而杰出的总法律顾问。卢拉斯基既不被视为最高级的领导人之一，也不被视为未来寻求领导地位的人。发出的信号很清楚：该组织的高级领导人，并不希望行使更多的权力。自上而下的决策，也是由一个对权力没有渴望的人来处理，而且明确保证这个举措是暂时的。


      如果蔚蓝这种在危机时期，需要暂停建议流程，有两个准则可以用来维持对自我管理的信任：对（不通过建议流程的）自上而下决策的范围和时间框架定义充分的透明度，并任命一个、在危机结束后不会被怀疑继续行使这种独裁权力的人，来作出决策。
  - topic: Fundamental Assumptions
    title: "During transition, two sets of belief systems were opposed to each
      other: the traditional Amber/Orange belief system and the new set,
      regarding self-management the logical way to operate. The traditional
      belief set was made explicit together with the colleagues, which made it
      very powerful and confrontational."
    content: >-
      Here is how Dennis Bakke (CEO of AES at that time) summarizes the
      assumptions workers feel bosses have about them:


      * Workers are lazy. If they are not watched, they will not work diligently.

      * Workers work primarily for money. They will do what it takes to make as much money as possible.

      * Workers put their own interest ahead of what is best for the organization. They are selfish.

      * Workers perform best and are most effective if they have one simple repeatable task to accomplish.

      * Workers are not capable of making good decisions about important matters that affect the economic performance of the company. Bosses are good at making decisions.

      * Workers do not want to be responsible for their actions or for decisions that affect the performance of the organization.

      * Workers need care and protection, just as children need the care of their parents.

      * Workers should be compensated by the hour or by the number of "pieces" produced. Bosses should be paid a salary and possibly receive bonuses and stock.

      * Workers are like interchangeable parts of machines. One "good" worker is pretty much the same as another "good" worker.

      * Workers need to be told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Bosses need to hold them accountable.


      And here are the new assumptions :


      AES people :


      * Are creative, thoughtful, trustworthy adults, capable of making important decisions;

      * Are accountable and responsible for their decisions and actions;

      * Are fallible. We make mistakes, sometimes on purpose;

      * Are unique and

      * Want to use their talents and skills to make a positive contribution to the organization and the world.
  - topic: Ownership
    title: A publicly held company reverses its ways during difficult times.
    content: "AES, an energy generation and distribution powerhouse was co-founded
      in 1982 by Roger Sant and Dennis Bakke. Under Sant’s leadership as CEO
      until 1994, and then with Bakke at the helm, it grew from a two-person
      firm into a global energy producer employing 40,000 people in plants
      located in more than 30 countries around the world.\r

      \r

      AES became a Wall Street darling after it was publicly listed in
      1991. For years, while the company was going from success to success, the
      board members were supportive of AES’s radically decentralized and
      trust-based decision-making. And yet as Bakke commented, “Most board
      members loved the AES approach primarily because they believed it pushed
      the stock price up, not because it was the ‘right’ way to operate an
      organization.”\r

      \r

      AES’s fortunes turned in the early 2000’s. Following the dotcom
      bubble burst, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Enron bankruptcy, which
      caused near panic among energy investors, AES’s stock price, which had
      peaked at $70, declined to as low as $5. AES’s earlier decisions to invest
      in “merchant plants” that sold electricity in the spot market as opposed
      to under long-term contracts and to finance much of its growth with debt
      no doubt contributed to its troubles. However, these decisions could not
      be attributed solely to its decentralized structure as they had been
      discussed and agreed to all the way up to the board level. Nevertheless,
      fear took over among board members, and they imposed greatly increased
      oversight including the hiring of lawyers and consultants as well as a
      co-CEO whose directives Bakke was asked to carry out. After nine
      frustrating months, Bakke left, which freed the board to direct the
      conversion of AES to traditional management practices.^[Laloux, Frederic.

    title: AES replaced staff with task forces and mandated time allocated to them.
    content: >-
      With 40,000 people scattered around the globe but only around 100 staff in
      its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia,
      [AES](https://www.aes.com/home/default.aspx) had no central maintenance or
      safety departments, no purchasing, no HR, and no internal audit
      departments. The company came up with the "80-20 rule": every person
      working at AES, from cleaning staff to engineer, was expected to spend on
      average 80 percent of their time on their primary role and make themselves
      available for the other 20 percent in one or more of the many tasks forces
      that existed around the company.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing
      Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 89].


      Note that AES was handed over to new management in 2001, who decided to revert to more conventional management approaches.
  - topic: Dismissal
    title: AES introduced a generous severance program and a loan fund to make
      post-acquisition layoffs mostly voluntary and less traumatic.
    content: >-
      [AES ](http://www.aes.com/)has demonstrated a distinctively Teal approach
      to layoffs due to structural overstaffing after buying power plants
      previously owned by governments. After the acquisition, AES had to lay off
      hundreds of people and managed to do that relatively painlessly through a
      special voluntary severance program. Here is Dennis Bakke‘s, CEO,
      perspective on the matter:


      *"The right size of a workforce is equal to the number of people needed to make the workplace fun. Having too many employees demoralizes colleagues and causes turf battles. A very astute AES plant manager in Northern Ireland told me that arguments over turf are good indicators that the facility has too many people. No one worries about who does what when there is enough work to go around. My belief that business should not carry unneeded employees does not mean that they should be given pink slips and hustled out the door. Departing employees need time to make the transitions to new work. Organizations should be generous with severance arrangements. We encountered overstaffing almost every time we made an acquisition. One of the first things we did after acquiring a business was to set up a generous and voluntary severance program. Only rarely were individuals asked to leave. In Panama, AES created a loan fund for employees who took the severance package. A year later, I traveled to a celebration lunch with former employees who had left the company. Seventy-one new businesses had been started by these former employees, most of whom tapped the AES loan fund. Even with generous voluntary severance arrangements, the changeover from a company you know to one you don’t can be traumatic. I strongly believe that these difficult transitions are a necessary evil that forces employees and organizations to adjust to a dynamic world. Part of the joy of work is learning new roles and taking on new responsibilities. Job security is attractive gift wrapping, but seldom is there anything of lasting value inside.*"^\[Source: Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), pages 187-188]
  - topic: Staff Functions
    title: AES, in a heavily regulated industry, pioneered the use of 80/20
      voluntary task forces to deal with typical staff functions.
    content: >-
      AES, with its 40,000-employees, functioned in self-managing teams of 15 to
      20 people during its period under Teal practices. Believing that bad
      things start to happen when any site becomes too big, AES also tried to
      limit the number of employees in a site to a maximum of 300 to 400 (15 to
      20 teams of 15 to 20 people)―the natural limit, they felt, for colleagues
      to more or less put names and faces together and enter into a casual
      discussion with any colleague.


      Teams at AES were responsible for decisions relating to all aspects of day-to-day operations: budgets, workload, safety, schedules, maintenance, hiring and firing, working hours, training, evaluations, compensation, capital expenditures, purchasing, and quality control, as well as long-term strategy, charitable giving, and community relations.


      This is quite remarkable: AES is an energy provider, operating thermal and hydroelectric power plants as well as electrical grids. This equipment is absolutely central to the lives of many people and businesses. Operating problems can lead to disastrous blackouts, and accidents to the loss of many human lives. And yet millions of customers throughout the world were supplied with energy produced by self-governing teams responsible for such crucial matters as safety and maintenance.


      With 40,000 people scattered across different continents, AES only had about 100 people working at headquarters in Arlington―hardly a number that could claim to control what was happening in faraway places like Cameroon, Colombia, or the Czech Republic.


      And yet, it worked. A front-page article in the Wall Street Journal illustrates with a story how far teams at AES went with taking on responsibilities typically handled by headquarters:


      *MONTVILLE, Conn. –– His hands still blackened from coal he has just unloaded from a barge, Jeff Hatch picks up the phone and calls his favorite broker. “What kind of rate can you give me for $10 million at 30 days?” he asks the agent, who handles Treasury bills. “Only 6.09? But I just got a 6.13 quote from Chase.” In another room, Joe Oddo is working on J.P. Morgan & Co. “6.15 at 30 days?” confirms Mr. Oddo, a maintenance technician at AES Corp.’s power plant here. “I’ll get right back to you.” Members of an ad hoc team that manages a $33 million plant investment fund, Messrs. Oddo and Hatch quickly confer with their associates, then close the deal. …*


      It sounds like “empowerment” gone mad. Give workers more autonomy in their area of expertise? Sure. Open the books to employee purview? Perhaps. But what good could possibly come from handing corporate finance duties to workers whose collective borrowing experience totals a mortgage, two car loans, and some paid-off credit-card debt? Plenty of good, says AES. … “The more you increase individual responsibility, the better the chances for incremental improvements in operations,” argues Dennis W. Bakke, the company’s chief executive and one of its founders. … “And more importantly” he says “it makes work a lot more fun.”


      Is giving coal handlers investment responsibility risky? Mr. Bakke thinks not. He notes that the volunteer team in Montville does have a financial adviser, and they work within a narrow range of investment choices. They aren’t exactly buying derivatives. What the CEO likes about the arrangement is that “they’re changed people by this experience. They’ve learned so much about the total aspect of the business, they’ll never be the same.”


      With only around 100 staff in its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, AES had no central maintenance or safety departments, no purchasing, no HR, and no internal audit departments. In a smaller company, when an issue arises in one of these areas, people can simply call a meeting, or delegate a specific coordinating role to a colleague. At AES, with 40,000 people scattered around the globe, that was no longer feasible. The company came up with the “80-20 rule”: every person working at AES, from cleaning staff to engineer, was expected to spend on average 80 percent of their time on their primary role and make themselves available for the other 20 percent in one or more of the many task forces that existed around the company.


      Take investment budgeting, normally the prerogative of finance staff at headquarters. At AES, everything happened in the field; every team established its investment budget once a year. Investment budgets would be added up at the plant level, sometimes running as high as $300 million in a year. When teams were satisfied with the consolidated budget for the plant, it was reviewed, together with those from all other plants, by a budget task force that would suggest possible changes and improvements (but didn’t have power to enforce changes). That task force was staffed with a few people from headquarters with relevant expertise, but predominantly with people from local units with all sorts of backgrounds―a security guard could sit next to a technician and an engineer.


      Internal audits were performed in the same way, by volunteer task forces: each plant would be audited by colleagues from other plants. Task forces were put in place for topics as diverse as compensation, community service, environmental work, and corporate values.


      AES found out that using voluntary task forces instead of fixed staff functions has multiple benefits. Employees find avenues to express talents and gifts that their primary role might not call for. They develop a true sense of ownership and responsibility when they see they have real power to shape their company. Dennis Bakke insists on another point: these task forces are formidable learning institutions. At any point in time, thousands of people would be involved in task forces, picking up technical and leadership skills from more experienced colleagues. It’s a modern-day form of apprenticeship, scaled to a massive level. No classroom training could ever provide the amount of learning that was taking place day in and day out in the voluntary task forces.^[Alex Markels, “Blank Check,” The Wall Street Journal, April 9, 1998.]
