title: Reinventing Organizations Wiki
intro: >-
  ![](/media/book_image.png)    This wiki is based on the book Reinventing
  Organizations by Frederic Laloux. Its purpose is to explain the features and
  characteristics of organizations, emerging all over the world, that operate in
  a very different and perhaps more evolved way.

  The wiki is best used as a reference, a sort of handbook, for leaders looking to upgrade specific management practices in their organization.


  ![](/media/heart_image.png)    It is a labor of love, the work of a joyful community, dedicated to soulful organizations everywhere coming to life.

  We  invite you to [contribute ](https://surveyheart.com/form/5f12c56c042b2b3696da7a2e)by updating the relevant pages with your own learning and experience.


  ![](/media/down_image.png)    The aim is to provide practical advice, guidance, and deep knowledge to all who would like to embrace this new way of working and being.
