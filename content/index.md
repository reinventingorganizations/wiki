  This wiki is based on the book Reinventing Organizations by Frédéric Laloux. Its primary purpose is to serve as a practical guide for leaders who are reinventing their organization and are looking for inspiration as they upgrade specific management practices in their organization.


  It is a labor of love, the work of a joyful community, dedicated to soulful organizations everywhere coming to life. We  invite you to[ join us and contribute](/pages/how-can-you-contribute)  to add cases and insights to this wiki.
