### Synergy between the Wiki and Enlivening Edge magazine

![](/media/enlivening-edge-and-wiki-synergy.jpg)

#### Why  a synergy between these 2 sources for inspiration ?

* This synergy is connecting 2 aspects of the same reality: a story for inspiration ([Enlivening Edge](https://www.enliveningedge.org/)) and articles to support a go for action ([wiki](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/rs))
* The wiki gives a structure for people who want more than being in flow, browsing, and discovering, it is there when you need to find things again. Wiki is structure, and it can refer back to an EE article. EE can also include the personal inspiring stories. EE enables searching for topics. There is a synergistic difference: Wiki connects people with knowledge, and EE is purposed ultimately to connect people with people.
* it is connecting the rich resources available for people interested to learn more about new organization's paradigm
* EE is enabling writers to tell more of their story, extending to different aspects
* this is making the sharing stories less labor-intensive for us, which benefits everyone
* this creates more Teal "artifacts" in the world that people can discover and connect with like-minded people
* creates a culture of common understanding of Teal

#### How to contribute?

* For EE : <https://www.enliveningedge.org/enlivening-edge-writers-guidelines/> page.
* For the wiki : [/pages/editing-guidelines](editing-guidelines)
* Organizations can write one or both articles. 

#### What to contribute with?

* An Enlivening Edge Magazine story that can inspire people/organizations 

  * "Backstory" or what happened that resulted in where you are. 
  * Your current challenges and triumphs. 
  * What's happening now for your organization. 
  * Connections with people and other organizations that you find valuable
  * Events/courses/programs/workshops you either have put on or have found helpful or that you're planning.
* A Case Study illustrating a wiki article which articulates **concretely** how a practice or a mindset is embodied/carried out in action/demonstrated by your organization. Like a how-to manual for **putting Teal consciousness into operation in an organization.** The purpose is to support organizations looking for real examples when they go thru their own journey.
