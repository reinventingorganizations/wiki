### Important introduction

This list of criteria / decision is an INITIAL framework for our team to work with. 

ANYBODY inside the wiki team decide to continue this conversation, enrich the ideas feeding the initial decisions, and carry foward the production of a 2.0 (or later release) of this page.

## Decisions on Criteria / Process v1.0

1. Organization ideal profile (see below exceptions to this) : 

   * Minimum 100 persons working for the organization
   * At least 5 years since the start of the Teal journey
   * At least 2 from the 3 main focuses (Evolutionary purpose, wholeness, self-management)
   * Top manager of the organization supports the case information, and he/she is open to further questions.
   * Prefer organizations that are under-represented inside the wiki (e.g. public sector) or have practices that are less illustrated (e.g. Self-management !)
   * Organizations that are recognized as poineers or inspiring in other sources like Enlivening Edge magazine, Corporate Rebels, ... can be good starting points

2. Process inside the wiki team

   * When a person in the wiki team is convinced of a case, we could give it a try: this person with be the case owner
   * The case owner needs to find a peer in the wiki team and have conversation with her/him, create a Trello card for it, put access to all material available inside the Trello case card. This team of 2 is responsible for contacting the organization, organizing the conversations with them, prepare this articles, organize the english proof check.
   * When the final version of the articles are ready the case owner launches an advice process with the whole wiki team from the Trello card (calling @board to read it). He or she explains what were the criteria used, and the prefered criteria (point 1 here above) are NOT met, explain what still makes the case worth to be in the wiki. So exceptions to basic rules are welcome, they need to be understood by all.
   * The case owner also makes sure the pointer to the mast version of the articles are clear from the Trello card. From there anybody inside the wiki can comment, make suggestions, and article might be revised accordingly.
   * When the review process is finished (e.g. allowing 2 weeks to the people to see and reply to the case proposal), the case owner takes the decision to publish the case, or not.
   * A formal OK is requested to the organization before the publication. The agreement is stored in Trello as an attachment. This mightsound overkilling but can be a good way to protect us a an organization and as volunteers , just in case.
   * The article is published, including in its introcution a way to connect to the organization for further information
