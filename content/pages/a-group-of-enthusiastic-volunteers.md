A group of enthusiastic volunteers

![](/media/group-of-enthusiastic-volunteers.png)

From all ages (20 and 80+), from all regions of the world (UK, USA, Hungary, Spain, Argentina, Peru, Denmark, Germany, France etc.), we are a team of volunteers who give a little of our time to share the practices of organizations on their way to a new stage of consciousness.

We share different roles, working on:

* new cases of organizations that can illustrate interesting teal practices.
* the evolution of the core articles
* the technical improvement of the website

the details about our organization is available [in this Peerdom Map](https://peerdom.org/ror-wiki/map?view=circles)

So we always welcome authors, reviewers, interviewers, open source developers ...
