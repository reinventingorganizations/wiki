### Onboarding new Wiki contributors

![](/media/tree.jpg)

* #### Invite the person as member of the **Trello** Board <https://trello.com/b/a0Bm3Zed/rowiki-articles>
* #### For content contributors (articles / cases)

On the CMS, we can update most of the content.
The Netlify Content Management System (CMS) supporting the Wiki edition is located here <https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/home>.

People will need to create an account there (Netlify admin need to validate this request). If there is delay in this process please raise a flag in Trello card <https://trello.com/c/Pjr2BioY>

A powerpoint file has been developped when this CMS was tested with some hints about how to use Netlify, it can be accessed here :

* #### For Web developpers willing to contribute on Github

The Github project for this site is accessible at https://github.com/reinventingorganizations/wiki

There are already a nice list of enhancements possibilities highlighted for the Wiki, please visit the Trello board here : <https://trello.com/c/Z490CACi>
