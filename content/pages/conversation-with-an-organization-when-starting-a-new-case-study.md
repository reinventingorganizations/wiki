### Conversation with an Organization when starting a new case study

![](/media/conversation.jpg)

#### Here are the key messages when having this discussion:

* The purpose of the wiki is to share experiences so that people in their transformation journey can be inspired by other organizations experiences
* The best way to help people find resources in this Wiki is to have a case description which is

  * concise ( not more than 1/2 a page, 300 words or so)
  * concrete, practical,
  * neutral in tone
* Each organization could choose to pick 1, 2 or more practices, processes or topic detailed in the Wiki articles
* The organization reads the article in detail in order to clarify for themselves if the practice they choose to describe really matches the teal paradigm
* The organization will stay in link with the wiki team contact for support
* It is possible that the organization, beyond their practice description(s), would like to give more context to their case, tell the story (why did they choose to go to Teal, who had embodied this in their organization, …. any inspiring detail). They can then choose to write an article for Enlivening Edge Magazine ( check [/pages/draft-the-synergy-between-the-wiki-and-enlivening-edge-magazine](<*/pages/draft-the-synergy-between-the-wiki-and-enlivening-edge-magazine>) for the details about the synergy between Wiki and EE)
* If an EE article is written in future , it is key to cross link articles between EE and Wiki cases.
* Keep this exercise small at start, iterative, realistic, and make it a joyful experience!
