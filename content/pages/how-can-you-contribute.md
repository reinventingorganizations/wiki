#### There are 3 complementary ways in which you can contribute to this wiki

1. **Share teal practices from your own organization!** Please fill out this [short form](https://surveyheart.com/form/5fb632d8c99c116adc299908) so that we can contact you (please note, that as we are volunteers, it might take a week or longer for us to respond).
2. **Join our group of enthusiastic volunteers!** We are looking for people happy to enrich and maintain the wiki, and there are different tasks to do and roles to fulfill. For example to review the current articles (for example language editing), or to write new articles. Or maybe to translate the wiki to other languages? We also need web developers familiar with github and \[the platform infrastructure]. The wiki has been developed in open source and we have a number of enhancement requests waiting for your talents! Please [fill out this form](https://surveyheart.com/form/5f12c56c042b2b3696da7a2e) so that we can contact you.
3. **Give feedback!** You can also react to what you have read in the current version of the wiki and [give feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKJ9e_35o57wtjr5F2NrlptK1ULTCawjJqSqOxNdvQ1lWFzA/viewform?c=0&w=1).
