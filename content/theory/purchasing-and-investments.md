  organisations.

  With respect to purchasing and investments, [Teal
  organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) exhibit the following
  general measures:


  * Anybody can spend any amount provided the [advice process](../decision-making/) is respected.

  * The one who suggested an investment takes the responsibility to conduct and monitor the purchasing process.

  * Team investment budgets and purchasing can be challenged by peers.


  Employees’ power to make decisions using the [advice process](../decision-making/) is perhaps most evident when it comes to spending company money. In [self-managing](../self-management/) organizations there are no authorization limits and no procurement departments. Employees or teams do the analysis, create the necessary specifications, visit and negotiate with suppliers, and even secure financing from the bank if needed.


  In contrast, purchasing and investments in earlier stage organizations can be characterized as follows:


  #### Red organizations


  In the [Red paradigm](../red-organizations/), the boss or owner of an organisation decides generally on his own what to purchase or where to invest. There are typically no formal documented processes. Investments are made opportunistically, even impulsively, based on the boss's preferences. 


  #### Amber organizations


  In the [Amber paradigm](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/), purchases and investments are made by dedicated top level resources within the hierarchy following simple, but strict rules. Investments are now less impulsive following medium or long term planning. Purchasing itself could be done at lower levels of an organisation, as long as it follows defined rules. Control mechanisms typically exist ensuring compliance to these rules.


  #### Orange organizations


  In the [Orange paradigm](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), the strict general rules of the Amber paradigm become more open and fluid. Rules can be questioned or changed to support innovation. Parts of the organisation are empowered to decide on purchasing and investments within a given range on their own. The [breakthrough of Accountability](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) is an important step to distribute investment decisions within the organisation (e.g. into projects) to innovate more and faster. Distributed investment decisions are accepted as long as they follow the overall direction formulated by the top management and the teams reach the desired outcome. A frontline manager might be free to spend up to $1,000 but require authorization from his bosses beyond that amount; a unit manager might have spending power up to $10,000 and a plant manager up to $100,000. Whatever the amounts, the purchase order must generally proceed through a central procurement department that coordinates the relationships and negotiations with suppliers.


  #### Green organizations


  The [Green paradigm](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) decisions about purchasing and investments are pushed more to the frontline workers. The top down planning of [Orange organisations](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) is enriched by bottom up processes involving the operational experts. The [breakthough Empowerment](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) activates creativity and responsibility of the teams giving enough space to purchase or invest within budget boundaries and within the values system of the organisation. Most organizations still have authorization limits in place. More decentralized or distributed procurement processes (often supported by software tools) should speed up decision processes and enhance the agility of operations teams.

  #### Anybody can spend any amount provide the advice process is respected


  An employee who needs a new $50 printer doesn’t have to call the IT department, hope for a green light from his boss, and wait the days or weeks it takes for the printer to arrive. He can simply head down to the specific shop or website and buy a printer. In principle, any person can spend any amount of money, provided he has sought the necessary advice before making the decision; the larger the purchase, the more people are typically involved in the [advice process](../decision-making/). In hierarchical organizations, when engineers do the analysis and choose a machine model, workers often complain about the new machine and drag their feet when it comes to learning how to operate it. When they have chosen the model, there is no such resistance to change. Organizations might vary in how to conduct the advice process, with some employing formal, written rules while others adopting a more informal, ad hoc process. Whatever specific process finally is chosen, it is based on transparency and trust.


  #### The one who suggested an investment takes the responsibility to conduct and monitor the purchasing process


  In self-managing organizations, workers are in charge of the full purchasing or investment process. They do the analysis, write up the necessary specifications, visit and negotiate with suppliers, and secure financing from the bank if needed. It does not necessarily mean that the initiator needs to conduct all steps on his own, but at least he takes the responsibility from start to end.


  #### Peer-based challenging of teams' investment budgets


  Especially in larger organisations, a transparent baseline budget is very helpful to let teams monitor whether a new investment can and should be funded or not. Different from non-Teal organisations, investment budgets aren't given or confirmed from higher levels of management. They are created based on realistic assumptions of the teams about what needs to be purchased during a planning period. If the collected numbers are in balance to expected revenues and seem reasonable, the investment budget is set. Any investments fitting into it don't need further investigation as long as the [advice process](../decision-making/) is conducted. Companies like [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/) do annual intensive budget planning sessions, in which each team presents its investment plans to a panel of peers for advice. Teams that are not performing well are likely to be challenged as to whether spending money is really the best way to fix their problems.
faq:
  - question: What about volume discounts?
    answer: "Surely money is left on the table if purchases are not pooled? As
      often, the answer is: trust people to make the right decisions within the
      framework of [self-management](../self-management/). For items where
      volume discounts are too good to give up, colleagues who buy from the same
      vendor will choose to coordinate to maximize their buying power. At
      [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/), a tomato processing
      company, colleagues noticed that lots of people were buying threadlocker,
      an adhesive that prevents nuts and bolts from accidentally loosening, in
      dozens of different formats and from different vendors. They were not only
      losing out on volume discounts, but the uncoordinated purchasing generated
      unnecessary bureaucracy because regulations in the food industry required
      workers to painstakingly track every threadlocker format in a Material
      Safety Data Sheet. At some point, a worker suggested that he could walk
      around the plant once a quarter and ask colleagues if they wanted to order
      threadlocker through him. A similar solution emerged for purchasing
      packaging materials, an area where volume discounts can quickly add up.
      When there is value in coordination, people simply start to coordinate."
  - question: What about standardization?
    answer: It often makes sense to buy computer or telephone equipment from the
      same or compatible vendors, for instance. Again, one can simply trust the
      [advice process](../decision-making/). A secretary buying herself a new
      computer, unless she is very well versed in hardware and software
      specifications, will likely seek advice from a knowledgeable party to
      ensure the computer will easily fit in with the rest of the IT equipment.
      In this case, there is no need for a central department to enforce
      standards. In more complex cases, when standards need to be specified,
      someone will step up and call together a group that will look into the
      matter and define the standards.
  - question: What about an investment that does not fit into the budget?
    answer: From time to time an investment might not fit into the budget for some
      reason. Possibly the investment is based on a sudden event or a valuable
      opportunity. As with [Orange
      organisations](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), spontaneous
      investments should be accommodated under Teal. Again, the [advice
      process](../decision-making/) is used to handle such situations. If a
      particular department or group needs an increased budget allocation, they
      can solicit support from other groups who might be willing to give a piece
      from their budget. Challenging questions should be asked and answered, but
      finally there will be a decision driven by the collective intelligence of
      representatives of the teams.
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      [Self-management](../self-management/) heavily impacts purchasing and investments. Every employee is enabled to take action and innovate in his working context. Investments are initiated from where they are needed. The [advice process](../decision-making/) creates a deeper understanding of the impacts of investments. The localized responsibility for purchasing leads to a greater satisfaction about what is bought because the user defines the specifications.


      #### Wholeness


      To decide about investments a deep holistic understanding about the inter-dependencies and reach of a decision is necessary. The [advice process](../decision-making/) creates a wide transparency about the impacts of an investment. Especially when it is a bigger amount of money, it is essential to understand the company's financial situation and investment impacts on others as a whole.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      One important criterion about investments is whether it fulfills an [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). Distributed investment decisions empower those sensing the organization's purpose to act in a way to serve that purpose.
