  ## 新视角


  关于采购和投资[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)一般遵循以下原则：


  * 任何人都可以决策支出任何金额，只要遵循[建议流程](../decision-making/)即可。

  * 建议投资的人负责实施并监督采购过程。

  * 团队投资预算和采购决策，可能会受到组织内其他同类团队的类比挑战。


  关于如何使用公司资金，最为明显的案例也许是让成员拥有利用[建议流程](../decision-making/)做出决策的权力。在[自我管理](../self-management/)的组织中，不存在授权限制，也没有专门的采购部门。成员或团队可以在不需要任何人批准的前提下，通过自发分析，制定必要的规范，访问供应商并与之谈判，甚至在需要时从银行获得融资。


  早期组织的采购和投资与蔚蓝不同的特征如下：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，组织的老板或所有者通常会独裁决定购买什么或投资哪里。通常没有正式的文件化过程。投资是基于老板的偏好，甚至是冲动性的。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，购买和投资是由层次金字塔结构中高层的专门成员，按照简单但严格的规则进行决策。伴随着中长期规划的引入和实施，投资不再像红色那么冲动。采购本身可以在组织的较低层次进行，只要遵循预制的规则。通常设计一些确保遵守这些规则的控制机制。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色模式](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，让琥珀范式那种严格的规则变得更加开放和流动。为了支持创新，出现了可以质疑或改变规则的可能性。组织的部分部门可以得到授权自行决定在给定预算范围内的采购和投资。这种 [橙色的突破性自我责任制](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)，是将投资决策分配到组织内部（例如项目中）以实现更多更快创新的重要一步。在橙色组织，分布式投资决策是可以接受的，只要能遵循最高管理层制定的总体方向，团队能达成预期结果即可。一个经理的授权可能被定义在10万美元之内，经理要花费10万美元以上就需要上司批准。无论金额多少，采购订单通常必须通过一个中央采购部门集中实施，该部门负责协调与供应商的关系并进行谈判。


  #### 绿色组织


  [绿色模式](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)将关于采购和投资的决策进一步推到了一线成员身上。[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)那种自上而下的规划，在绿色中通过采用运营专家支撑的自下而上流程而得到丰富。[绿色的突破性授权机制](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)可以激发团队的创造力和责任感，在预算范围内和组织的价值体系内，授予团队层面的购买或投资决策权得到了扩展。大多数组织仍然设有授权限制。绿色引入了更加去中心化或更分布式的采购过程（通常由软件工具支持），用来加快决策过程，并提高运营团队的灵活性。

  ## 实践中


  #### 只要遵循建议流程，谁都可以决策任何金额的采购


  例如，某成员需要一台新的50美元打印机，可以不必打电话给IT部门并期待其上司批准，然后等上几天或几周收到打印机。他可以直接到特定的商店或网站购买打印机。原则上，任何人都可以花任何数量的钱，前提是他在做决定之前征求了必要的建议；购买规模越大，通常参与[建议流程](../decision-making/)的人就越多。在等级制组织中，当工程师通过分析选择机器型号时，工人经常会不喜欢新机器，于是会在学习如何操作新机器时拖拖拉拉。如果是一线采用自己选择的型号，就不会有这种对改变的阻力。不同组织在如何实施建议流程方面可能会有所不同，有些组织采用正式的书面规则，另一些组织则采用非正式的临时方式。但无论最终选择何种具体做法，本质都是基于透明度和信任。


  #### The one who suggested an investment takes the responsibility to conduct and monitor the purchasing process


  In self-managing organizations, workers are in charge of the full purchasing or investment process. They do the analysis, write up the necessary specifications, visit and negotiate with suppliers, and secure financing from the bank if needed. It does not necessarily mean that the initiator needs to conduct all steps on his own, but at least he takes the responsibility from start to end.


  #### Peer-based challenging of teams' investment budgets


  Especially in larger organisations, a transparent baseline budget is very helpful to let teams monitor whether a new investment can and should be funded or not. Different from non-Teal organisations, investment budgets aren't given or confirmed from higher levels of management. They are created based on realistic assumptions of the teams about what needs to be purchased during a planning period. If the collected numbers are in balance to expected revenues and seem reasonable, the investment budget is set. Any investments fitting into it don't need further investigation as long as the [advice process](../decision-making/) is conducted. Companies like [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/) do annual intensive budget planning sessions, in which each team presents its investment plans to a panel of peers for advice. Teams that are not performing well are likely to be challenged as to whether spending money is really the best way to fix their problems.
faq:
  - question: What about volume discounts?
    answer: "Surely money is left on the table if purchases are not pooled? As
      often, the answer is: trust people to make the right decisions within the
      framework of [self-management](../self-management/). For items where
      volume discounts are too good to give up, colleagues who buy from the same
      vendor will choose to coordinate to maximize their buying power. At
      [Morning Star](https://www.morningstarco.com/), a tomato processing
      company, colleagues noticed that lots of people were buying threadlocker,
      an adhesive that prevents nuts and bolts from accidentally loosening, in
      dozens of different formats and from different vendors. They were not only
      losing out on volume discounts, but the uncoordinated purchasing generated
      unnecessary bureaucracy because regulations in the food industry required
      workers to painstakingly track every threadlocker format in a Material
      Safety Data Sheet. At some point, a worker suggested that he could walk
      around the plant once a quarter and ask colleagues if they wanted to order
      threadlocker through him. A similar solution emerged for purchasing
      packaging materials, an area where volume discounts can quickly add up.
      When there is value in coordination, people simply start to coordinate."
  - question: What about standardization?
    answer: It often makes sense to buy computer or telephone equipment from the
      same or compatible vendors, for instance. Again, one can simply trust the
      [advice process](../decision-making/). A secretary buying herself a new
      computer, unless she is very well versed in hardware and software
      specifications, will likely seek advice from a knowledgeable party to
      ensure the computer will easily fit in with the rest of the IT equipment.
      In this case, there is no need for a central department to enforce
      standards. In more complex cases, when standards need to be specified,
      someone will step up and call together a group that will look into the
      matter and define the standards.
  - question: What about an investment that does not fit into the budget?
    answer: From time to time an investment might not fit into the budget for some
      reason. Possibly the investment is based on a sudden event or a valuable
      opportunity. As with [Orange
      organisations](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), spontaneous
      investments should be accommodated under Teal. Again, the [advice
      process](../decision-making/) is used to handle such situations. If a
      particular department or group needs an increased budget allocation, they
      can solicit support from other groups who might be willing to give a piece
      from their budget. Challenging questions should be asked and answered, but
      finally there will be a decision driven by the collective intelligence of
      representatives of the teams.
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      [Self-management](../self-management/) heavily impacts purchasing and investments. Every employee is enabled to take action and innovate in his working context. Investments are initiated from where they are needed. The [advice process](../decision-making/) creates a deeper understanding of the impacts of investments. The localized responsibility for purchasing leads to a greater satisfaction about what is bought because the user defines the specifications.


      #### Wholeness


      To decide about investments a deep holistic understanding about the inter-dependencies and reach of a decision is necessary. The [advice process](../decision-making/) creates a wide transparency about the impacts of an investment. Especially when it is a bigger amount of money, it is essential to understand the company's financial situation and investment impacts on others as a whole.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      One important criterion about investments is whether it fulfills an [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). Distributed investment decisions empower those sensing the organization's purpose to act in a way to serve that purpose.
