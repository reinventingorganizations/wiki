intro: 团队/社区建设是组织成功的关键因素。团队的有效性取决于团队成员之间的关系及其对团队集体意识的赞赏感激和理解。本节介绍加强团队内部连接纽带的不同努力和方法。

  ## 新视角


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，团队的动力的是共同的目标、高度的意识水平以及员工之间的强大纽带关系。成员共创并共享美好。成员的弱点不是被视为缺陷，而是一种有用的敏感性，一种可以帮助团队在不需要主管或经理监督的情况下，自主学习和成长所必须的感应能力。人性内在的紧张情绪可以自由的浮现表达出来，并在团队心灵中得到解决。随着组织走向蔚蓝，人与人之间的纽带越来越紧密，越来越开放。


  人类组织在每一个历史阶段都产生了对团队/社区建设的不同观点，以及非常不同的实践：


  ### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，团队是靠领导者的魅力和及其向成员传递能量和目标的能力来维持。领袖的力量和权力保护着本社区，减少对外界威胁的恐惧和担忧。


  ### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，管理人员对自己团队的成果负责。他们会给出指示，明确的参数、过程和政策来指导决策。团队效率通常取决于其管理者以清晰而实际的方式传达目标的能力。通常认为不需要双向交流。员工通常对自己的组织有强烈的归属感，并会在同事群体中形成紧密的纽带关系。人们通常与组织中同一级别的人进行社交。


  ### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，团队合作技能被视为一种有助于提高员工绩效和生产力的方法。橙色组织经常推广团队建设活动，并将其融入公司结构中。团队建设被认为是一种竞争活动。这些活动有时旨在提供强烈的情感体验（面对挑战、极限运动、聚会等），以此强化人们的纽带关系。团建经常会包括学会理解人的各种不同性格类型，以便让成员学会包容，为了团队的利益而调整自己的行为。


  ### 绿色组织


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，存在着能与同事安心分享私人情感和情绪的空间。经常组织娱乐和社交活动，增进人们的相互了解。这些努力能增加同事之间的理解和信任。团队建设的另一个目标是，通过自下而上的流程来支持共享价值观和目标愿景的发展。团队或社区建设活动通常由人力资源部推动。绿色组织作为社会责任战略的一部分，还经常投资进行外部环境社区参与和社区建设活动。


  ### 蔚蓝组织


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，人与人之间强大的纽带关系带来的力量，往往会培育出一个激励倾听集体智慧的环境。每个人都以自己的方式做出贡献，都认识到当团队繁荣时，自己自然就会茁壮成长。鼓励人们全身心投入工作，在一个值得信赖的环境中自由而放心的分享自己的性格弱点、想法和优势。蔚蓝组织采用的实践流程能支持开放而信任的沟通，激励职场的创造力。也经常成员鼓励花时间静下来，通过冥想或静默练习来反思而提升内在自我。

  ## 实践中


  ### 将完整人性带入职场


  [蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) 鼓励尊重成员的完整人性参与实践和工作。人的感情、思想、身体侧面，有时还包括灵魂侧面都得到尊重和培育。通过开发团队的共同语言来支撑纽带关系，成员用这种特殊而安全的语言来表达自己的感情和思想。蔚蓝组织通过创建和维护[安全而开放的职场](../safe-space/)来支持社区和团队建设。鼓励通过集体反思活动来发展集体智慧。团队建设已经成为这些组织日常工作的有机部分，而不再是“团队外出日”的刻意单独活动。


  ### Reflective Practices


  Large and small group reflective practices are used to help people grow their ability to explore and develop an idea.


  When everyone can freely express their feelings, thoughts, emotions and needs, space is created for everybody to be themselves and better understand others. People learn to see each other in the light of their humanity and in the beauty of their strengths and vulnerability.


  An example practice is:


  * A topic is selected and presented by someone. Then small groups of people (between 6-10) share their reflections and feelings. 

  * The facilitator establishes a few ground rules to create a safe space that allows people to be authentic and vulnerable in their exploration.

  * There is no scripted outcome to these meetings, no expected end product; everyone comes out of the meeting with his or her own personal learning.


  Often, collective insights emerge, as well as decisions and initiatives that are then carried out when people go back to work.


  ### Peer coaching


  Peer coaching is a process that allows an individual to draw on the power of the team to address a specific issue. It is often a deeply nourishing process for the individual and valuable bonding experience for the team as they share their wisdom and knowledge.


  ### Silence


  To listen to our inner wisdom , we need to find time to slow down and be still amidst the noise and buzz of the work place. Teal organizations typically support practices of mindfulness and silence in the workplace. Organizations like [Sounds True](http://www.soundstrue.com/) or [Heiligenfeld ](http://www.heiligenfeld.de/)offer space and time for silence or meditation, sometimes when the day starts, or at points during the working day. Collaborating in silence brings a special quality to relationships between colleagues. It requires a new level of mindfulness, listening less to what colleagues say, and more to their presence, feelings, and intentions.


  ### Team supervision / Conflict resolution


  Working in teams, which is what most people do in [self-managing ](../self-management/)organizations, invariably brings up tensions. Employees run into colleagues with different styles, preferences, and belief systems. They can choose, as most organizations do, to sweep the tensions under the rug. Or they can choose to confront and address them. Doing so invariably allows those involved to grow. When tensions and feelings are shared in a productive and respectful way, issues can be identified and resolved for the good of the organization. [Conflict resolution](../conflict-resolution/) skills are thus often necessary to improve team work.


  ### Storytelling


  When we reveal more of who we are, we have an opportunity to create deep, rich, and meaningful relationships. Many Teal organizations have found that story telling, is an effective way of doing this.  Storytelling is woven into many of the recurring practices of the organization.


  For example, at a staff retreat, a question might find its way into the program:


  “Tell us about an elder who has been important in your life?”


  “Tell us about the first dollar you ever earned?”


  People are invited to share their stories if they want to. The practice is simple and yet it allows people to share a defining moment with their colleagues. Such questions can be built into recruitment, on boarding processes, training workshops, annual evaluations, staff retreats, and large group processes (such as Appreciative Inquiry, Theory U, Open Space, World Cafe).
faq:
  - question: Aren't these practices time consuming?
    answer: "It’s a time-consuming practice for sure but generally when done
      continuously the benefits far outweigh the costs. The trust, empathy, and
      compassion that build up the kind of practices expand well beyond the
      confines of the meeting room. These feelings start to permeate the whole
      organization.\r

      \r

      Self-management requires people that have the courage and feeling
      safe to speak up. Ensuring that employees are capable to express
      themselves in genuine ways are very important, also for that reason."
