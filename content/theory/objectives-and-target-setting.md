  ## **新视角**


  在蔚蓝组织中，团队和个人不依靠管理来确定方向，而是根据内在驱动自主的实现组织的目标。不需要目标和预算形式的外部激励因素，来保证工作的完成。当成员觉得有必要的时候，会自主制定自己的目标和指标。


  蔚蓝组织通过感知和响应环境而发展。通过倾听[进化目标](../evolutionary-purpose/)，决定团队或整个组织的下一步行动。


  组织发展的每一个历史阶段都产生了对目标和指标设定的不同看法，以及截然不同的做法：


  #### **红色组织**


  [红色组织](../red-organizations/)的特点是机会主义和频繁的反应性行为。目标和指标设定不是个正式的流程，而是基于保护和/或扩大权力的内在驱动。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，目标是由高级管理层设定的。来自下级的唯一输入是技术或操作信息。这些技术和信息有时是作为其工作本分上报，有时是为了回复上级的信息索求。实现这些目标的计划以指令形式向下级发布，目标包含在指令之内。成员与最高管理层几乎没有直接的接触机会，即使一线成员根据对基层情况的经验/知识，认为或建议应该采取不同的行动，也还是要遵守指令，没有机会提出。


  #### **橙色组织**


  [橙色组织](../Orange_Organizations)将战略规划流程正规化了，将愿景、使命、价值观和目标设定，定义为正式规划流程的有机部分，并通过组织作为一台机器来层层过滤并实施。从董事会和执行层出发，下发到事业部、团队或部门。然后责成各下级阶层的成员进而制定符合公司愿景、使命和目标的局部战略计划。


  橙色组织通过在不同的层次设定目标，实现了从[琥珀](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)的“指挥和控制”到“预测和控制”的提升。最高管理者制定总体方向和战略，并以层层相关的目标、目的和指标的形式在组织中传达。管理人员和职能人员可以自由地利用自己的创造力来实现这些目标，组织有时还会为这些贡献提供奖励。如果协调得很好，中层管理层，以及较低级别的管理层，（在一定程度上）有权决定实现目标的具体办法。如果没有经过缜密的协调，这种方法可能会导致目标博弈，有时团队之间会相互对抗以确保实现自己的目标。


  #### **绿色组织**


  用来描述以划一、共识为中心的[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)的隐喻是“家庭”。绿色对权力和等级制度感到不舒服，所以把指挥和决策权从管理者转移到成员身上。但在实践中，成功的绿色组织模式中确实仍保有层级结构。管理者通常是服务型领导，他们负责支持和促进成员的成长。通常在团队级别上通过协商一致的方式设定目标和指标，以支持预定义的组织愿景和任务。


  #### **蔚蓝组织**


  可以用仿生或生物化系统来比喻的[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)，围绕着明确的目标组织活动，但目标（使命）并不是由最高管理层来设定。蔚蓝的目标是一个由组织所有成员共享的自我进化性内容。


  与蔚蓝组织的目标相匹配的计划，都基于“感知和响应”，聚焦于寻找可行解决方案的敏捷方法。这种适应性过程类似于敏捷原型启动和 [[软件开发](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development%7Cagile)] 原理。决策在整个组织的价值观框架内做出，并通过一个[建议流程](../decision-making/)获得公众协调。战略是成员与组织环境互动的有机产物。自我管理的成员可以为自己设定目标，单元团队也会决定一些目标，比如更快的周转时间，但不会设定销售、效率或其他角度的绩效目标。在立项或内容变更之前，致力于征求同事和专家的意见（蔚蓝称之为建议流程）以确保能涵盖包括财务责任在内的所有方面的要素。组织共识的价值观包括，任何一个成员或一组成员，都不能因为考虑不周或出于私利的行为或项目，而置组织于危险之中。

  ## **实践中**


  #### **设定目标的不利之处**


  在橙色的成功驱动模式中，目标和指标是成功的关键驱动力。是将组织凝聚在一起并赋予组织存在意义的粘合剂。但在进化主题的蔚蓝范式中，组织被[目标](../listening-to-purpose/)和[价值观](../culture-and-values/)drive the organization. The objective is to bring to life the purpose of the organization. There are no formal systems or top-down processes in place for setting objectives and targets. All the functions of management (planning, organizing, direction-setting, investments, budgeting, etc) are done by the people doing the work. In general, Teal-Evolutionary organizations tend not to set objectives or targets.


  From a Teal-Evolutionary perspective, objectives and targets are problematic:


  * They rest on the assumption that we can predict the future,

  * They skew behavior from intrinsic to extrinsic motivation,

  * They tend to narrow the ability to sense new possibilities,

  * They focus attention on the targets, rather than fulfilling the organization’s purpose,

  * In the Orange-achievement world they always imply growth, something which is not always an inherent element of Teal organizations' purpose.


  #### **Sense and respond – a new way to determine objectives, goals and strategy**


  Instead of trying to predict and control (the implicit goal behind objectives and targets), Teal organizations sense and respond. You could say that all target setting is instead initiated locally where it is "sensed and responded" to, then cascades or emerges through the organization as a living system as needed.


  One example is the Buurtzorg Boardinghouse. Nurses noticed or sensed that primary care-givers of their patients needed a break from the ongoing demands of providing care. In response, they instituted a bed and breakfast-type solution where patients could receive care, providing care-givers a respite. There were no goals or objectives for Buurtzorg to become a bed and breakfast, but nurses sensed a need and their response of respite care took them down this path benefiting patients and care-givers in the process.


  We cannot plan for a world that is continuously changing, and where we have no control over the changes. So Teal-Evolutionary organizations work on the basis of sense and respond, rather than predict and control.


  #### **Investment process**


  The closest that Teal-Evolutionary organizations come to setting objectives is the investment process. Most organizations have an annual investment process, where each team prepares its investment plans for the next year. These plans are added up, and, if they exceed available/accessible resources, the teams have to review and adjust their plans. Whether the investments are part of the annual plan, or ad-hoc, situational investments, teams are responsible for raising the external funding themselves, or negotiate internally with other teams for funding or resources.


  Some Teal-Evolutionary organizations do have organization-wide objectives, or perhaps guidelines. For example, [Buurtzorg](http://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/), the Netherlands-based health care organization, has a target for billable hours of 60 - 65% for their mature teams.


  #### **Team determined targets**


  People and teams can choose to set objectives or targets for themselves as measures that tell them how well they are doing at meeting the organization's purpose. Machine operators may set quality or performance targets for themselves. Teams may set objectives in order to get a new project up and running, or they may have set themselves targets for turnaround times. This is simply part of self-management, as opposed to objectives and targets imposed from above (outside the team or individual). Measurements are chosen that help the team better sense key changes and respond to them.


  #### **Distributed responsibility and shared accountability**


  Teal-Evolutionary organizations do not set sales targets. However, everyone, including the sales people, are fully aware and informed of what it takes to keep the organization going. Since sales people are part of the operational teams, they know how much work is required to keep the team going.
faq:
  - question: If no sales targets are set, how will the company know how much to
      sell to achieve both break even and profitability?
    answer: >-
      Financial information is available to all, and everybody is trained to
      read and understand financial information. They are also trained how to
      relate the information to their activities. Since every member is
      responsible for the health of the whole organization, they know exactly
      what outputs are required to keep the organization financially healthy.


      Whether the teams have specific persons in sales roles, or are responsible for sales as part of their ongoing duties, everybody has a clear idea of what is happening in the marketplace, what customers' needs are and what other offerings there are.


      The beauty of the [self-organizing ](../self-management/)nature of [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) is that they can sense and adapt to market changes in real-time. Orange-Achievement organizations have to wait for feedback from sales teams and market research, then go through a laborious target setting and decision making process and then implement changes.
