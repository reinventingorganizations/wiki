  ## 新视角


  蔚蓝组织之前所有阶段的组织都是金字塔结构，原因很简单：这是老板-下属关系的自然结果。在自我管理的组织中，同侪承诺取代了上司与下属的关系，金字塔消失了。权力是分散的，工作由分布式的、自我管理的团队或网络来完成。金字塔的静态等级制度让位给了流动的自然等级制度，在此，影响力流向了最有专业知识、激情或兴趣的人。蔚蓝组织摆脱了指挥和控制结构的僵化和迟钝，可以更迅速地作出反应，更加充满活力。各种反应“道法自然”的发生：组织的整体行为从团队和个人的行为中自然“出现”。^\[Teal organizations can be thought of as an example of a “complex adaptive system”: a "complex macroscopic collection" of relatively "similar and partially connected micro-structures" formed in order to adapt to the changing environment and increase its survivability as a macro-structure. They are complex in that they are dynamic networks of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive in that the individual and collective behaviors mutate and self-organize corresponding to the change-initiating micro-event or collection of events."

  下面介绍蔚蓝之前的组织结构：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，组织围绕着一个强大的领导者构建，这个领导者主要是出于恐惧而对其他人行使权力。没有什么正式的等级制度，红色组织在很大程度上依赖于首领的能力让所有成员保持一致，就像群狼围绕着头狼。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，出现了有上下级关系的组织结构图，形成了层次金字塔和清晰的指令链条。人们认同职务头衔和他们在等级制度中的地位。决策由层次结构的上层做出，下层只是服从指令。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，尽管获得了更多的自由，金字塔仍然是最基本结构。项目组、虚拟团队、跨职能计划、专家工作人员职能和内部顾问等，都是为了打破严格僵化的职能和层级界限，以加快沟通和促进创新而设置。


  #### 绿色组织


  [绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)通常仍采用金字塔结构运作，但一线成员的权力和自由度更大些。要求高层管理者分享控制权：领导从实干者、问题解决者和万金油转变为“仆人领导”。这通常是一个“倒金字塔”的象征，底层的CEO支持高层和中层管理人员，后者再来支持一线成员。

  ## 实践中


  虽然金字塔在蔚蓝组织内消失了，但蔚蓝组织的自我管理并不是单纯的扁平化恶平等构造。到目前为止的蔚蓝组织，根据其不同的运作环境，似乎分为三大类结构。这将在本文做进一步描述。不过这些类型都具有共同属性：权限分散，自然的分层结构。


  ##### *权力分散*


  在传统的等级制度中，权力集中在上层，以自上而下的方式行使：老板可以批准或否决下属的决定。在蔚蓝组织中，权力是分散的：每个感觉到问题或机遇的人都可以采取措施，利用组织对当前主题的集体智慧（流程），启动一个[决策过程](../decision-making/)。这些方法——有时被称为“建议过程”——并不是全体一致的共识决策（而是某个体站出来代表集体做出决策，这是典型的主权积分体运作方式），共识决策是对自我管理结构的一种普遍误解。


  ##### *自然的分层结构*


  关于自我管理的另一个常见误解是，认为是每个人都是“平等的”，在决策中应该有平等的发言权。事实上，当传统的等级制度不复存在时，许多自然的和流动的自然分层结构就会开花——一种基于发展、技能、才能、专长和认可加权的等级制度。在每一个问题上，会有某些同事比其他人更有专业知识、激情、或者更愿意出力。决策权和影响力自然流向这些拥有专业知识或愿意作出贡献的人。流动的、自然的等级制度取代了金字塔的固定权力分层。一个人的影响力取决于其才能、兴趣、技能和同事的信任。不再由个体在组织结构图中的等级位来强制决定或固定化各个成员的权力和影响力。


  #### 结构原型


  自我管理的组织采用不同的形式来适应其独特的运作环境。到目前为止，似乎已经出现了三种类型的自我管理结构：


  1. 平行团队

  2. 个人承包网

  3. 嵌套团队（圈子） 


  这些结构并不是相互排斥的，有些组织是这些类型的混合体。

  图中文字：适合于价值链很短的大规模组织：零售，服务企业，部分制造业，学校，医院，公共服务等。


  这是迄今为止在蔚蓝组织中最常见的结构。^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 319.]案例包括布尔佐格（地理团队）和法维（客户团队）（见下文“启发性实践案例”）。如果组织已经成熟到能以团队高度自治的方式分解工作，而不需要太多跨团队的协作时，就非常适合此模型。团队并肩工作。在这个模型中，同事们在团队中自定义自己的角色以及他们对彼此做出的相互承诺。团队通常还会自治的处理招聘、规划、确定投资需求、制定预算（只在需要预算的情况下）、跟踪财务和非财务结果等。


  蔚蓝组织在理想的情况下，每个团队都是完全自主的，从头到尾执行所有任务。在这种情况下，组织中的每个成员都会满意地看到整个组织的目标实现，而不是像大型专业组织中那样，只是其中的一小部分接触到大目标。但有时，在具体业务实践的某些更局部的焦点上，通常还是需要一些人或团队去承担协作或支持角色：


  * *团队教练:* 在蔚蓝组织中，没有中层管理人员。但团队通常会感觉到需要外部人员来支持自己解决问题。在布尔佐格，这些人被称为区域辅导；在RHD，则称为枢纽经理。

  * *支撑团队*: 某些任务，不需要每个团队都设同一个重复职能。例如，在法维，绝大多数团队都是面向客户的单元——奥迪团队、大众汽车团队等。然而，还有少数团队专门负责支持其他团队，例如铸造团队。由各团队轮流运作一个铸造厂很不现实，投资重复的设备在每个团队中建一个铸造厂也毫无意义。RHD则设有公用支撑单元，比如负责培训（其“小型大学”）、房地产和工资管理等职能团队，这些部门支持外围的所有团队单元。

  * *支撑角色:* The self-management model pushes expertise down to the teams, rather than up into staff functions. But for certain specific expertise or for coordination purposes, creating a supporting role can make sense. At FAVI, for instance, there is an engineer who helps teams exchange innovations and best practices.


  ##### *Web of individual contracting*


  ![Michael K Sahota - 30 mai 2015 à 21:13](/media/individual_contracting.png "Individual Contracting")


  Individual contracting, as has been pioneered by Morning Star, a California-based tomato processing company, is a natural fit for continuous and relatively stable processes, such as can be found in the chemical industry, in food processing, or in long assembly chains. Each major step in the process often involves only a few people, and so a nested structure is not needed. Through individual one-on-one contracting, colleagues can make clear agreements with their upstream and downstream counterparts and anyone else they work closely with. These commitments are often formalized in a written document.


  Investment budgets and financial results, on the other hand, are set up and discussed in teams, just as in the model of parallel teams. (Morning Star calls them “Business Units,” and each Business Unit is linked to a particular step in the process―say, tomato preparation, dicing, canning, or packaging―or to a support service―for instance, steam generation or IT.)


  ##### *Nested teams (Circles)*


  ![Frederic Laloux - 29 juin 2015 à 12:22 - Update file of nested teams (presented as concentric circles rather than stacked in a pyramidal fashion ](/media/nested_teams_2-medium.png "Nested Teams")


  Some industries have not only long, but also deep value chains, when certain steps in the value chain involve both a large number of people and complex tasks (for instance, research in a pharmaceutical company or marketing in a large retail bank). Consumer electronics firms, large media companies, banks, insurance companies, car manufacturers, aerospace companies, and airline companies are likely to have long and deep value chains. For these types of companies, nested teams (often called circles) might be particularly appropriate, as they allow an overall purpose to be broken down into successively less complex and more manageable pieces.


  This structure was formalized by Kees Boeke in the mid 20th century in a system called Sociocracy (first applied in a school in the Netherlands). Holacracy, an organizational system pioneered by Brian Robertson in his software company Ternary Software, is also structured in concentric circles (see “Concrete examples for inspiration” below).  


  Through nesting, circles gradually integrate related activities, so there is a hierarchy of purpose, complexity, and scope, but not of people or power. Each circle has full authority to make decisions within the scope of its specific purpose. Decisions are not sent upwards, and cannot be overturned by members of overarching circles.
faq:
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      ###### Self-management


      Teal organizational structures are driven by self-management. The traditional boss-subordinate relationship gives way to a decentralized team structure and peer to peer commitments.


      ###### Wholeness


      Pyramidal structures are built on the (often unconscious) assumption that people cannot be trusted and must be controlled by their hierarchical superior. In Teal organizational structures, people are freed from the constraints of authority and can thus show up more fully.


      ###### Evolutionary purpose


      In Teal organizations, people’s actions are guided by their sense of the organization’s evolutionary purpose, not by what they are being told to do by someone higher up the organizational chain. Self-managing systems, based on sense and respond as opposed to command and control, tend to evolve much faster and respond more quickly to changes in the environment. Pyramidal organizations tend to change through less frequent, less timely and more brutal re-organizations.
  - question: What then, if any, is the role of a leader?
    answer: "In today’s world, the predominant, default organizational model is that
      of the pyramid, with an executive committee, middle managers, staff
      functions, and policies and procedures to ensure control. Self-managing
      systems are still the exception, and many people's default behaviors, even
      in established self-managing organizations, can revert to those of more
      traditional, hierarchical management. This might explain why in all
      self-managing organizations to date, the founder or the most senior
      “leader” has filled one particular role: that of \"holding the space\" of
      distributed authority. Whenever people in the organization, consciously or
      unconsciously, revert to traditional management control mechanisms, the
      leader reminds everyone about the [fundamental assumptions
      ](../fundamental-assumptions/)and encourages them to find solutions in
      line with the self-managing nature of the organization."
  - question: If the organization is structured in teams, should there be structure
      within the teams? Should there be a team leader?
    answer: >-
      In self-managed teams, many management tasks disappear, since people are
      no longer being “managed”. Other tasks (planning, setting objectives,
      monitoring team performance, recruiting, etc.) remain, and it is up to the
      team to make it clear among themselves what the various roles and task
      responsibilities of the team members are. In some cases, such tasks can
      simply be spread among team members (I do the planning, you lead the
      recruiting, etc.). Such a model works well when the nature of the team’s
      operational roles allows for flexibility (e.g., knowledge workers who can
      interrupt their primary work or nurses who can take time between patient
      visits for administrative tasks). Other types of work require fixed and
      dedicated hours that cannot be easily interrupted. Teachers, for instance,
      can't easily leave the classroom and machine operators can't easily leave
      their workplace. In such cases, it might be necessary to have a team
      coordinator that isn't tied to a classroom or a machine to take on a
      number of the management tasks.


      Having a team coordinator nevertheless carries a risk. Our cultural baggage of hierarchy is so strong that over time, team coordinators could start behaving like bosses and become the primary decision makers on their teams. At FAVI, a simple but powerful relief valve exists. Should a team leader find the taste of power too sweet, workers can choose at any moment to join another team.
