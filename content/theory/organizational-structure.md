  ## 新视角


  蔚蓝组织之前所有阶段的组织都是金字塔结构，原因很简单：这是老板-下属关系的自然结果。在自我管理的组织中，同侪承诺取代了上司与下属的关系，金字塔消失了。权力是分散的，工作由分布式的、自我管理的团队或网络来完成。金字塔的静态等级制度让位给了流动的自然等级制度，在此，影响力流向了最有专业知识、激情或兴趣的人。蔚蓝组织摆脱了指挥和控制结构的僵化和迟钝，可以更迅速地作出反应，更加充满活力。各种反应“道法自然”的发生：组织的整体行为从团队和个人的行为中自然“出现”。^\[Teal organizations can be thought of as an example of a “complex adaptive system”: a "complex macroscopic collection" of relatively "similar and partially connected micro-structures" formed in order to adapt to the changing environment and increase its survivability as a macro-structure. They are complex in that they are dynamic networks of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive in that the individual and collective behaviors mutate and self-organize corresponding to the change-initiating micro-event or collection of events."

  下面介绍蔚蓝之前的组织结构：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，组织围绕着一个强大的领导者构建，这个领导者主要是出于恐惧而对其他人行使权力。没有什么正式的等级制度，红色组织在很大程度上依赖于首领的能力让所有成员保持一致，就像群狼围绕着头狼。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，出现了有上下级关系的组织结构图，形成了层次金字塔和清晰的指令链条。人们认同职务头衔和他们在等级制度中的地位。决策由层次结构的上层做出，下层只是服从指令。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，尽管获得了更多的自由，金字塔仍然是最基本结构。项目组、虚拟团队、跨职能计划、专家工作人员职能和内部顾问等，都是为了打破严格僵化的职能和层级界限，以加快沟通和促进创新而设置。


  #### Green organizations


  [Green organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) typically still operate with the pyramid structure, but there is more empowerment of front-line employees. Higher managers are asked to share control: to move from being doers, problem solvers and fixers to being “servant leaders”. This is often symbolized by an "inverted pyramid", where the CEO at the bottom supports senior and middle managers who in turn support front-line employees.
inPractice: >-
  Although the pyramid disappears in Teal, it would be a mistake to think that
  self-managing organizations are simply flat and structureless. Teal
  organizations to date seem to fall into three broad types of structure to fit
  the context in which they operate. These are described further below. However
  all share the common attributes of distributed authority and natural
  hierarchies.


  ##### *Distributed authority*


  In traditional organizations, when power is concentrated at the top, bosses can approve or invalidate a decision made by a subordinate. In Teal organizations, power is distributed There are no bosses, only coaches. Anyone who senses a problem or an opportunity can initiate a [decision making process](../decision-making/), using methods that leverage the collective intelligence of the organization.


  In traditional hierarchies, power is concentrated at the top, and can be exercised in a top-down fashion: bosses can approve or invalidate a decision made by a subordinate. In Teal organizations, power is distributed: everyone who senses a problem or an opportunity can step up and initiate a [decision making process](../decision-making/), using methods that leverage the collective intelligence of the organization about the topic at hand. These methods —sometimes called "advice process"— don't involve, as a common misconception about self-managing structures, consensus decision making.


  ##### *Natural hierarchies*


  A common misconception about self-management is that everyone is "equal" and should have equal say in decisions. In reality, when traditional hierarchies are gone, lots of natural and fluid hierarchies blossom―hierarchies of development, skill, talent, expertise, and recognition. On every issue, some colleagues will have more expertise than others, more passion, or more willingness to help. Decision rights and influence flow to those who have the expertise or willingness to contribute. Fluid, natural hierarchies replace the fixed power layers of the pyramid. A person’s influence depends on her talent, interest, skills, and the confidence of her colleagues. It is no longer determined by her position in the organization chart.


  #### Archetypes of structure


  Self-managing organizations adopt different forms to fit the context in which they operate. There seem to be three broad types of self-managing structures that have emerged so far: 


  1. Parallel teams 

  2. Web of individual contracting

  3. Nested circles 


  These structures are not mutually exclusive, and some organizations exhibit a mixture of these types.


  ![](/media/parallel_teams-medium.png)


  This is the most common structure found to date in Teal organizations.^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 319.]Examples would include Buurtzorg (geographic teams) and FAVI (client teams) (see “Concrete examples for inspiration” below). This model is highly suitable when work can be broken down in ways that teams have a high degree of autonomy, without too much need for coordination across teams. They can then work side by side. In this model, it is within the team that colleagues define their roles and the mutual commitments they make to each other. Teams also typically handle their own recruitment, planning, establish their investment needs, devise a budget (if a budget is needed), track their financial and non-financial results, and so on.


  In an ideal situation, each team is fully autonomous and performing all tasks from start to finish. When that is the case, every single person in the organization has the satisfaction of seeing the entire organization’s purpose come to life, and not just a small slice of it as is often the case in large specialized organizations. In practice, there will often be a need for some people or teams who take on coordinating or supporting roles with a more narrow focus:


  * *Team coaches:* In Teal Organizations, there are no middle managers. But teams often feel a need to be supported by someone external that can help them work through problems. At Buurtzorg, they are called regional coaches; at RHD, hub leaders.

  * *Supporting teams*: For some tasks, duplication in every team doesn’t make sense. At FAVI, for example, the great majority of teams are client facing―the Audi team, the Volkswagen team, etc. However, a few teams support other teams, such as the foundry team. It would not be practical for the teams to operate the foundry in turns, nor would it make sense to duplicate the equipment and have a foundry within each team. RHD has units responsible for areas such as training (its “miniversity”), real estate, and payroll, that support all the units in the field.

  * *Supporting roles:* The self-management model pushes expertise down to the teams, rather than up into staff functions. But for certain specific expertise or for coordination purposes, creating a supporting role can make sense. At FAVI, for instance, there is an engineer who helps teams exchange innovations and best practices.


  ##### *Web of individual contracting*


  ![Michael K Sahota - 30 mai 2015 à 21:13](/media/individual_contracting.png "Individual Contracting")


  Individual contracting, as has been pioneered by Morning Star, a California-based tomato processing company, is a natural fit for continuous and relatively stable processes, such as can be found in the chemical industry, in food processing, or in long assembly chains. Each major step in the process often involves only a few people, and so a nested structure is not needed. Through individual one-on-one contracting, colleagues can make clear agreements with their upstream and downstream counterparts and anyone else they work closely with. These commitments are often formalized in a written document.


  Investment budgets and financial results, on the other hand, are set up and discussed in teams, just as in the model of parallel teams. (Morning Star calls them “Business Units,” and each Business Unit is linked to a particular step in the process―say, tomato preparation, dicing, canning, or packaging―or to a support service―for instance, steam generation or IT.)


  ##### *Nested teams (Circles)*


  ![Frederic Laloux - 29 juin 2015 à 12:22 - Update file of nested teams (presented as concentric circles rather than stacked in a pyramidal fashion ](/media/nested_teams_2-medium.png "Nested Teams")


  Some industries have not only long, but also deep value chains, when certain steps in the value chain involve both a large number of people and complex tasks (for instance, research in a pharmaceutical company or marketing in a large retail bank). Consumer electronics firms, large media companies, banks, insurance companies, car manufacturers, aerospace companies, and airline companies are likely to have long and deep value chains. For these types of companies, nested teams (often called circles) might be particularly appropriate, as they allow an overall purpose to be broken down into successively less complex and more manageable pieces.


  This structure was formalized by Kees Boeke in the mid 20th century in a system called Sociocracy (first applied in a school in the Netherlands). Holacracy, an organizational system pioneered by Brian Robertson in his software company Ternary Software, is also structured in concentric circles (see “Concrete examples for inspiration” below).  


  Through nesting, circles gradually integrate related activities, so there is a hierarchy of purpose, complexity, and scope, but not of people or power. Each circle has full authority to make decisions within the scope of its specific purpose. Decisions are not sent upwards, and cannot be overturned by members of overarching circles.
faq:
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      ###### Self-management


      Teal organizational structures are driven by self-management. The traditional boss-subordinate relationship gives way to a decentralized team structure and peer to peer commitments.


      ###### Wholeness


      Pyramidal structures are built on the (often unconscious) assumption that people cannot be trusted and must be controlled by their hierarchical superior. In Teal organizational structures, people are freed from the constraints of authority and can thus show up more fully.


      ###### Evolutionary purpose


      In Teal organizations, people’s actions are guided by their sense of the organization’s evolutionary purpose, not by what they are being told to do by someone higher up the organizational chain. Self-managing systems, based on sense and respond as opposed to command and control, tend to evolve much faster and respond more quickly to changes in the environment. Pyramidal organizations tend to change through less frequent, less timely and more brutal re-organizations.
  - question: What then, if any, is the role of a leader?
    answer: "In today’s world, the predominant, default organizational model is that
      of the pyramid, with an executive committee, middle managers, staff
      functions, and policies and procedures to ensure control. Self-managing
      systems are still the exception, and many people's default behaviors, even
      in established self-managing organizations, can revert to those of more
      traditional, hierarchical management. This might explain why in all
      self-managing organizations to date, the founder or the most senior
      “leader” has filled one particular role: that of \"holding the space\" of
      distributed authority. Whenever people in the organization, consciously or
      unconsciously, revert to traditional management control mechanisms, the
      leader reminds everyone about the [fundamental assumptions
      ](../fundamental-assumptions/)and encourages them to find solutions in
      line with the self-managing nature of the organization."
  - question: If the organization is structured in teams, should there be structure
      within the teams? Should there be a team leader?
    answer: >-
      In self-managed teams, many management tasks disappear, since people are
      no longer being “managed”. Other tasks (planning, setting objectives,
      monitoring team performance, recruiting, etc.) remain, and it is up to the
      team to make it clear among themselves what the various roles and task
      responsibilities of the team members are. In some cases, such tasks can
      simply be spread among team members (I do the planning, you lead the
      recruiting, etc.). Such a model works well when the nature of the team’s
      operational roles allows for flexibility (e.g., knowledge workers who can
      interrupt their primary work or nurses who can take time between patient
      visits for administrative tasks). Other types of work require fixed and
      dedicated hours that cannot be easily interrupted. Teachers, for instance,
      can't easily leave the classroom and machine operators can't easily leave
      their workplace. In such cases, it might be necessary to have a team
      coordinator that isn't tied to a classroom or a machine to take on a
      number of the management tasks.


      Having a team coordinator nevertheless carries a risk. Our cultural baggage of hierarchy is so strong that over time, team coordinators could start behaving like bosses and become the primary decision makers on their teams. At FAVI, a simple but powerful relief valve exists. Should a team leader find the taste of power too sweet, workers can choose at any moment to join another team.
