  本文讨论何时、如何以及为了什么目的而组织会议。

  ## 新视角


  对不同历史阶段的组织而言，会议的目的各有不同。会议的数量通常随着组织的发展而增加，在绿色阶段达到顶峰。在蔚蓝阶段开会数量开始减少。


  蔚蓝组织的成员通常感觉到与同事在人与人之间、以及工作之间的联系更紧密，不再需要那么多会议来计划或解决问题。


  ### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，只是在首领或老板认为有必要时举行会议。会议目的可能是为了发布信息、传达判决或举行仪式。有时也会为了寻求建议或收集信息而开会。


  ### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀组织](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/theory/amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，会议是一种重要的层级控制方法。用于收集、提炼并在组织中上下层级间传递信息。会议负责人是参会者中最高级别的领导。其他人有责任按要求准备汇报或回答用的信息。


  ### 橙色组织


  [橙色组织](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/theory/orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)橙色组织需要认真管理绩效以确保实现各种指标和目标。这自然要求组织内每个层面都召开例会（周/月/季/年度）。


  开会的目的包括：


  * 报告进展并作出决定。

  * 计划。

  * 通过头脑风暴和其他创造性活动创新。

  * 审批投资和其他重要决策。

  * 确定优先级，等等。


  随着会议的激增，开会成了高级管理人员忙碌的“日程充盈”。至今依然如此，对一些受雇于国际组织的人而言，这往往意味着大量出差旅行。


  为了确保达成明确的结果，会议通常有预先确定的议程。重视理性讨论和逻辑论证。但，制定议程者个人层面的目的性，导致会议无法避免只重视表面内容，进而有妨碍组织目标的潜在风险。


  ### 绿色组织


  [绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)的目标是，本着平等、尊重和包容原则为多个利益相关者服务。所以就需要与这些方位开会。共识很有价值，但要达成共识可能会很辛苦。


  会议不仅为了（如在橙色组织那样）计划和汇报，同时也是为了催化主人翁责任感、包容感和赋权感：换句话说，就是创造一种基于价值观的文化。因此，会议活动往往更关注团队内部的基本流程。


  ### 蔚蓝组织


  [自我管理](../self-management/)允许[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)的成员在不需要批准或协商取得一致共识的情况下就能负责任的主持决策。因此，所需的会议通常要少得多。


  会议往往只在必要时举行。主要包括：


  * 根据建议流程的需要寻求建议

  * 共享信息

  * 应对不断变化的环境


  蔚蓝会议通常遵照一些具体的规则，以确保成员以相互尊重和富有成效的方式充分触及彼此并达成会议的目的。新加入者通常在这些过程中得到培训，以便学会如何能够充分参与蔚蓝会议。

  ## *实践中*


  #### 精简“会议”，只为“会面”


  每当组织成员感觉到需要开会，就会主动自发地召集会议。会议构造和精简原则在组织内早有共识，这些都支持着这种[自组织](../self-management/)精神。蔚蓝组织的高透明度，直接减少了会议次数和时间。在举行会议时，要注意使用能培养[整体感](../wholeness/)的一些具体技巧（组织价值观与文化的渗透）。


  #### 自我管理不需要很多会议


  总的来说，[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)的会议往往较少。在传统的金字塔结构中，因信息需要在指挥链中上下流动，于是需要召开会议来收集、包装、过滤和传输这些信息。在自我管理结构中，此类会议需求多数已经消失。[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中的会议可能是打造“自下而上”参与活动的一种方式，但在蔚蓝组织，这已经被“内置”在日常的自我管理结构中（不必刻意开会）。


  #### 一线团队/圈子层面例会


  团队/圈子会议的频率由工作性质决定。

  具体参见下文的法维案例。


  #### *议程*


  在传统组织阶段上，议程被认为是高效会议的最基本要素。但在蔚蓝职场就不见得。在蔚蓝组织中，即使一些有计划安排的会议，也都没有预先确定的议程。一般是在会议开始时刻确定议程（跟随同步性），并原则上选择一些当下能聚集参与者关注能量的话题。这样可以确保会议保持活力、目的性和参与性（避免人在心不在）。不预制仪式性的强迫方式和人造出来的议程（不用旧时间线的议程束缚当下流动），能保证成员对会议内容的兴趣是真实而当下临在的。


  #### *全体会议*


  当蔚蓝组织有新的重要的信息要分享时，就会安排全员参加的会议：季度业绩、年度价值观调查、战略拐点等等。在会上，信息并不是简单的自上而下“呈现”，而是展开真正的讨论和辩论。允许提问机制把会议带向任何方向；有挫折可以发泄；有成就可以自发庆祝。会议效果不仅仅是信息交换，还涉及到更多的有益能量（培养见证成员和组织的完整性）。成员对组织及其价值观的信任，能在会议中受到考验和重申。资深成员会坦诚、谦虚、脆弱吗？他们会直面这些难题吗？他们会允许整个团队都参与吗？


  与此对比，传统组织的全体会议则通常倾向于领导作报告为主。或者干脆避免全体会议，因恐惧这类会议（特别是允许成员人人发言时）的不可预测性和失控风险。


  #### 形式服从功能：会议应时自然发生


  团队间协调任务或启动特殊项目所需的会议，会自发出现。这是一种有机的组织方式。


  #### *A variety of meeting formats for different purposes*


  Examples include:


  * Team [decision-making ](../decision-making/)meetings at [Buurtzorg ](http://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/)

  * Holocratic Governance vs. Tactical meetings at [HolocracyOne ](http://www.holacracy.org/)

  * [On-boarding ](../onboarding/)meetings / Departure meetings as at [CC&R ](http://www.couragerenewal.org/)

  * Appraisal meetings

  * [Conflict resolution](../conflict-resolution/) meetings

  * [Listening to purpose ](../listening-to-purpose/)meetings

  * Large group reflections at [Heiligenfeld](http://www.heiligenfeld.de/)

  * [Culture/Values](../culture-and-values/) meetings

  * Praise meetings at [ESBZ ](http://www.ev-schule-zentrum.de/aktuell/)


  #### Highlighting sense of wholeness and purpose


  Meetings bring out the best and the worst of human nature.


  In the best, they are places where others help us listen in to what we really care about. But meetings can also be playfields for egos. To feel safe, some seek to dominate proceedings. Others withdraw. In self-managingorganizations the absence of a boss takes some of these fears out of the room. But in a group of peers egos can dominate just as well. A variety of approaches support productive interactions consistent with [wholeness ](/wholeness/)and [purpose](../listening-to-purpose/).


  #### Training in meeting practices


  Some train new members in effective meeting formats. New members need to be comfortable to participate in decision-making procedures.


  Training in facilitation, communication skills and mindsets support collegiality, trust building, and the resolution of tensions.


  #### Starting at the right place


  The beginning of a meeting sets the mood. [Teal Organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)may use the following practices:


  * One widespread practice is to start with a 'check-in' round. Participants share how they feel in the moment, as they enter. The helps all to listen within, to their bodies and sensations, and to build awareness. Naming an emotion is often all it takes to deal with it.  Thus, this practice helps participants let go of distractions while supporting everyone to be present for the current meeting. 

  * Or every meeting starts with a minute of silence to ground people in the moment. 

  * Meetings may start with at short reading that one person has prepared. After a few moments of silence, participants share the thoughts this has sparked.  

  * Another practice is to start every meeting with all sharing a brief story of someone they had recently thanked. This highlights possibility, gratitude, celebration, and trust.  

  * Yet another variant is a minute of silence and/or a joke.


  #### Keeping on track


  Additional practices to keep intention and attention in the meeting:


  * A volunteer holds of a pair of tingsha bells (two small hand cymbals that can make a crystal-like sound). If the holder feels ground rules are not being respected, she can make the cymbals sing. No one may speak until the cymbal sound has died out. During the silence, all can reflect on the question: "Am I in the service to the topic we are discussing?”  

  * Some use a 'talking stick' or other artifact to regulate turn-taking, slow down the speed of conversation, and increase the quality of listening. 

  * A facilitator may be used when there are specific requirements to fulfil. This may be an external facilitator in some circumstances.  


  #### Ending meetings


  Check-out rounds at the end of the meeting are a natural complement to the initial check-in round. They leave everyone with a sense of the impact of the meeting. A moment of silence is another way to reflect and conclude.  


  #### Meeting transparency / open participation


  Upcoming meetings may be listed on the intranet. This allows anyone who wants to share concerns or ideas to attend.  This transparency may extend to outsiders via streaming on the internet. Some claim this transparency results in closer relations with their external partners.


  Meeting cultures in [Teal Organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)have adopted some of the ‘alternative meeting formats’ like Open Space, Art of Hosting, World Café etc.
faq:
  - question: Doesn’t the advice process lead to more meetings rather than less?
    answer: >-
      Consulting with others, rather than making unilateral decisions, may mean
      more meetings. However, this is often more than made up for by savings
      elsewhere.


      Frédéric Laloux, tells this story as an illustration:


      “Jos de Blok, CEO of [Buurtzorg](https://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/), often applies the advice process by posting a blog note to the Buurtzorg web in the evening, proposing suggestions for new initiatives and decisions and asking for advice from all the members of the organization. 24 hours later, 50-80% of the employees will have read and perhaps commented. Maybe the overwhelming response is "yes, this is fine", in which case the decision can just be effectuated at this point. Alternatively, he will have received feedback on how he might be overlooking important negative consequences, or how this issue may be more complicated than he is aware off. In this case, he might revise his proposal accordingly and repost it, or sense the need to gather a voluntary group to deal with it. In any case this provides a swift [decision making process](../decision-making/) with very few meetings."


      Compare this to the process that typically takes place in a traditional 9000 employee hierarchy. Say the CEO wants to change overtime conditions:


      First he/she asks the Head of HR to prepare a proposal, who then asks someone more junior to do 'the staff work'. The junior drafts a proposal, maybe shows to a colleague and revises accordingly. Then the Head of HR goes over the draft, and suggests further refinements, before booking a meeting with the CEO who can make further changes. Then it goes to the executive committee...and so on...They want more revisions, and it goes down the line again, and back up again... It may now become political, bringing another layer of complications. If it is now approved, someone in internal communication works on it, and shows the CEO, again. Finally, it is cascaded to the managers who prepare presentations to make a team meetings. The total number meetings that may go into such a decision is huge.
