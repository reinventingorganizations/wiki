  环境和社会责任管理是指组织如何处理自己对环境和社会所带来影响的方针和做法。

  如今，许多公司都将企业社会责任、战略共享价值和标准化报告纳入其主要流程。其中有些组织将可持续性和可持续发展目标议程视为战略的一部分。

  蔚蓝的原则是增强组织的可持续性，因为社会和环境影响将成为组织日常生活的一部分。从进化论的观点来看，这一切都源于内在智慧和正义感。


  作为成员，我们可能很关心自己工作的环境和社区。在蔚蓝组织中，因为权力是分散的，所以对环境和社会服务类的倡议和项目，可以由组织内任何位置的充满激情的人联合起来自由发起。


  当我们基于完整生命的角度运作，就会感觉到需要尽自己的一份力量，来治愈我们与一切形式的生命之间的破裂关系。


  蔚蓝模式趋向于零废物、零毒性和对生态系统的零影响。


  作为起点，已经有福利公司（B-Corps，介于营利组织和非营利组织之间的模式）和霍尔模式的宪法等倡议，都为蔚蓝领导层提供了有趣的参考方法。


  随着时间的推移，组织在环境和社会责任的管理，已经开始从如何使用或开发资源，进化发展到如何为社会和环境提供服务。


  **红色组织**


  [红色模式](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/red-organizations) is based on social management via power. The organization is subject to nature and the environment, which might dictate tribal rhythms. Red sees the environment through the filter of the potential for use. What in the environment is open to be had, so that we may increase our ability to survive and prosper?


  **Amber organizations**


  In the [Amber paradigm](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/amber-paradigm-and-organizations), organizations tend to be self-contained, standing apart from the outside world, and run by a hierarchy. Social priorities favor those with status based on birth, education, and gender. The environment is viewed as predictable and organisations seek ways to control it for their benefit, for example in irrigation projects.


  With Amber, the first high cultures in the world emerged. The stable structures and long-term processes introduced brought unprecedented change to social structure and their potential.


  **Orange organizations**


  The goal-oriented organization of the [Orange paradigm](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/orange-paradigm-and-organizations) is focused on solving tangible problems. Growth is a consequence of successfully reaching your objectives, with a surplus of resources (profit). Not reaching objectives will over time, result in the organization dying. Thereis a belief that the strongest and best organizations will survive.


  In Orange organizations, social and environmental efforts are usually focused on ensuring that legal obligations are met. This does not necessarily imply that Orange dismisses the value of these causes. It is rather that these organizations can only justify taking actions which benefit society and environment if these actions also contribute to the objectives of the organization. To Orange, such initiatives would otherwise need their own organization, with objectives that include those goals.


  Some Orange organizations have embraced practices of [Corporate Social Responsibility ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility)constructively. Some contributions have been remarkable. Orange organizations frequently use their CSR initiatives to support their brand image through marketing.  


  **Green organizations**


  The[ Green paradigm](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/green-paradigm-and-organizations) considers the community (and by extension, the environment) as a stakeholder in the business. The pluralistic drive in Green means that it is important not only to be successful as an organization, but also to lift others up so that they also can be more successful.


  Dialogue with stakeholders is part of green organizations and, at the time, one of the core issues in CSR strategies


  The organization's mission is likely to include [social responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_responsibility). For example, [Green organizations](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/green-paradigm-and-organizations)  might work with suppliers in developing countries to maintain humane working conditions. They may focus on their [carbon foot-print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) or strive to make products and packaging recyclable.


  **Teal organizations**


  [Teal organizations](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/teal-paradigm-and-organizations) see themselves as part of a living system. That includes not only the organization itself but also the environment around it. Therefore, Teal organizations often take action to improve also their surroundings:


  * Social and environmental responsibility arises from what is sensed to be “the right thing to do,” based on [organizational values](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/culture-and-values).

  * Significant steps are taken to reduce waste, toxicity, and other impacts on the biosphere.

  * New practices may spring from anywhere in the organization.

  * Cost need not be the prime determining factor. 


  As society as a whole shifts toward the Evolutionary-Teal paradigm, we may see more legal experiments along the line of Holacracy’s constitution and B-Corps. In the final chapter of his book, Laloux speculates about an even more profound change: Perhaps in a Teal society, we would no longer think in terms of ownership, but in terms of stewardship? Such a shift would have profound implications in terms of legal ownership of organizations. Only time will tell if and how such a scenario will play out.

  #### How environmental and social practices arise


  Environmental and social practices arise from a sense of personal and corporate integrity.


  The guiding question is: What is the right thing to do?


  Initiative is distributed throughout the organization. Anyone can sense what is needed, and raise it.


  #### Values before profit


  Teal organizations strive to manage environmental and social practices ahead of profits. As [AES ](http://www.aes.com/)said in a public hearing: “If the company perceives a conflict between ... values and profits, it will try to adhere to its values - even if doing so might result in diminished profits or foregone opportunities”.


  #### Organization and environment are interdependent


  The metaphor of a Teal organization as a living organism, with its own purpose and intent, extends to the environment. Both organization and the environment it lives in are considered to be part of a living system. As such, the organization is dependent on its environment and the social structures that affect it. That is, the organization cannot thrive without a healthy environment.


  Teal organizations therefore often take a systemic approach to improve the environment or social structures in which the organization is active, especially when that environment is necessary to achieve the purpose of the organization.


  #### Sustainability before short term gains


  The theme of sustainability which is common in other Teal practices is also prominent in the area of environmental and social management. Teal insists on a long-term sustainable approach to delivering value. One of the reasons is that Teal feels that exploitation of life itself for short-term financial gain is immoral. Putting future potential of purpose at risk is considered reckless and the wrong thing to do.


  Teal often takes proactive measures to improve the environment and social aspects of its surroundings for the long term - in order to increase sustainability of purpose ― even if there may not be payoffs in the immediate term.


  #### Distributed initiatives


  Power is decentralized: passionate people can initiate activity from anywhere in the organization.


  When [Patagonia](https://eu.patagonia.com/hu/en/home/) moved its warehouse to Reno, four employees noticed that most of Nevada’s wild land was not protected wilderness. They sparked an initiative that resulted in 1.2 million acres of wilderness being protected.


  #### Integrated into the business


  [Teal organizations](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/teal-paradigm-and-organizations) do not (normally) have separate units for Corporate Social Responsibility. [Buurtzorg ](https://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/)adds new services in response to emerging social needs sensed by nurses, e.g. to help Alzheimer’s patients handle domestic chores.
faq:
  - question: I want my organization to do more to benefit society and the
      environment. Where do I start?
    answer: Encourage conversations that allow employees to raise their concerns.
      Create an environment that champions new practices. Social and
      environmental initiatives emerge when these [values
      ](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/culture-and-values)are
      aligned with the purpose of the organization.
  - question: How do we prioritize (between) environmental and social initiatives?
    answer: Via the [advice process](../decision-making/), initiatives can be
      assessed for fit with values and [evolutionary
      purpose](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/theory/entries/evolutionary-purpose)
      first. Other criteria might include impact, urgency and affordability.
  - question: Do we need to assess the affordability of environmental and social
      initiatives?
    answer: "[Self-management](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/ad\
      min/#/collections/theory/entries/self-management) works to balance
      spending in line with
      [values](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/collec\
      tions/theory/entries/culture-and-values) and
      [purpose](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/colle\
      ctions/theory/entries/listening-to-purpose). Employees’ own integrity and
      sense of self-censorship work together to ensure that spending is in
      alignment. Just as [Teal
      organizations](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/\
      collections/theory/entries/teal-paradigm-and-organizations) do not measure
      accountability according to multiple bottom lines, self-management guides
      spending within business capacity. [Teal
      organizations](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/admin/#/\
      collections/theory/entries/teal-paradigm-and-organizations) sense and
      respond. Budgets are used to make decisions; not to control variances."
