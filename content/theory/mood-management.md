intro: 情绪氛围直接影响潜力和可能性。情绪管理这一章概述了不同组织内如何处理情绪课题，如何找到很多做法，激励那些能带来期待产出的情绪，以及这些做法的实践效果。
perspective: >-
  人类组织在不同历史阶段，对情绪管理有不同见解和不同处理方式：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)mood management boils down to submission to the mood of the (tribal) chief and his “family”. They oversee the foot soldiers. Fear and submission keep the organization from disintegrating. 


  #### 琥珀组织


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)认为只有最高层“知道”部下的最佳利益。通过角色和规则管理这些被强加的愿景。奖赏那些遵守规则的人，惩罚那些不遵守规则的人。人们很看重这种秩序和可预见性。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，重视有计划有效率的结果。通常用激励措施来实现这些组织成果。目的只是激励/奖励某些行为，但不一定激励这些行为内隐含的情感或情绪。


  #### 绿色组织


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，和谐、宽容和平等受到重视。最受重视的是团队和社区健康。组织的目的是为了提高成员的积极性和动力。人力资源部会通过文化倡议、360度反馈和员工满意度调查等流程努力运作。开始有意识地关注情绪侧面。通常尝试尽可能满足所有利益相关者的需求（或情绪）。


  #### 蔚蓝组织


  * 蔚蓝组织认为情绪管理是融合剂，有助于打造良好的职场空间，能带来期待的产出成果，服务于组织目标。

  * 在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)把成员对目标价值的兴趣，促进自我导向和团结协作等要素组合起来，致力于提升情绪氛围。

  * 不设置情绪氛围管理专用的人力资源功能模块。由成员和小组全权负责，共同打造能让自己和谐工作的流程。

  * These practices may depart - sometimes radically - from traditional organizations. New recruits may find this difficult at first.

  * The best practices tend to be adopted across the organization.

  #### The way mood management works


  [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) recognize that mood mediates what is possible; that it predisposes certain courses of action, and closes off others. In [self-managed](../self-management/) organizations people value both autonomy and collaboration in pursuit of purpose. The practice of shared processes supports this. Purpose and practice conspire to produce a sense of shared belonging, alignment and potency. This sense of potency supports [innovation](../innovation-and-product-development/). People have ideas, seek support from colleagues and, when they work, share the enjoyment of their wider acceptance. These successes give rise to stories and practices. These, combined with 'wholeness events' are two contributors to the mood in the organization.


  Both may be used within hierarchical systems, too: they don’t depend on self-managing structures. But in Teal organizations they are more likely to arise from the inspiration of its members and their [shared values](../culture-and-values/). They may arise naturally, find their place, become openly adopted, and treasured.


  ##### *Storytelling*


  The stories people tell themselves and others reflect and reinforce mood. They convey memorable instances of shared values at work. What mood do we wish to share, and celebrate? Playfulness? Concentration? Prudence? Joy? Pride? Care? Gratitude? Curiosity? Determination? If we are self-managed, this selection is likely to be different for different people.


  Gratitude is one of the most powerful moods. We are satisfied. We drop our search for more. In this moment, we feel fulfilled. From that fullness, other emotions naturally emerge. We experience joy and generosity; we treat others with care. To nurture this consciously we need to discover and/or design practices that evoke gratitude, or related moods.


  We can ask: What stories can we share that evoke the mood that serves us best? In this fashion, [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) may create storytelling practices that support and expand the mood of appreciation while strengthening trust among the members.


  Storytelling practices take many forms:


  * Starting meetings with each participant in turn sharing a brief story of someone they had recently thanked or congratulated. ([FAVI](http://www.favi.com/)) 

  * Coming back to work from a day off (which included the task of expressing gratitude to somebody important in one's life), and sharing the experience with colleagues. ([Ozvision](http://ozvision.com/))

  * The Friday afternoon “praise meeting” in a school: sharing stories of kindness, courage, care, or professionalism as key to the school’s exceptional learning culture. ([ESBZ](http://www.ev-schule-zentrum.de/aktuell/))

  * The “Good Stuff Friday” e-mail: Started by one of the colleagues and sent to the entire workforce thanking a colleague or department for something that happened that week, or simply to share some good news. It invariably triggers an avalanche of recognition. ([BerylHealth](http://www.berylhealth.com/))


  ##### *Wholeness Events*


  Moods are also created by shared experiences: especially if they are filled with laughter, joy, fun, creativity, a feeling of trust, authenticity, belonging, acceptance and recognition.


  Traditional organizations may sponsor events, too - typically by HR or the CEO, for team building or similar. However, in a [Teal organization](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) they usually emerge out of the organization itself. When people feel safe enough to take the initiative, it seems that these self-created and organized events emerge spontaneously. We long, deep inside, to be in all of our humanity: the funny and the quirky, as well as the serious and responsible.  Human connections emerge from these places.


  Wholeness Events can be all kinds of things, like:


  * The self-organized “Art Salon” where everyone is invited to share an artistic passion. Some display photographs and paintings. Others perform (songs, dances, juggling ...), and so on. If people really enjoy themselves, these can become regular institutions. ([Sounds True](http://www.soundstrue.com/)) 

  * Fun at breakfast by showing up in pajamas to celebrate spring: so much fun was had at the premiere of this that now 90% of staff join in the annual self-organized “Pajama Day”. It is a celebration of community, fun, and getting to know colleagues in a completely different way. ([Sounds True](http://www.soundstrue.com/))
faq:
  - question: In a company we need to make money to thrive! So why should we bother
      with moods?
    answer: >-
      We certainly need money to thrive in a business. Should the questions be:
      What else do we need? Does this get in the way of, or support, financial
      health? 


      Many (especially younger employees) are disillusioned with what they perceive as an excessive focus on money; especially when it manifests as greed. The result is a widespread disengagement evident in surveys by [Gallup ](http://www.gallup.com/services/169328/q12-employee-engagement.aspx)and others. 


      A motivating work environment fosters financial success. [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) offer this via more autonomy and more community in pursuit of worthwhile purpose. These are clear motivators. They elevate 'mood'; they foster engagement; which in turn can correlate with financial health.
  - question: Isn't it too personal to deal with staff's moods?
    answer: >-
      'To deal with' infers 'to manage by others'. In some styles of
      organization this has been via programs initiated by senior management or
      HR.


      In [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) the practices that support elevated mood are often initiated by members and have optional participation. If staff can 'manage' their own practices, then the risk of being 'too personal' diminishes. It is fair to say, however, that new staff--especially senior ones--can find the move to a mood-sensitive organization difficult. This is a choice to be explored carefully during joining discussions.


      If 'mood' determines the choices open to individuals, groups and organizations, it still ranks as an important consideration.
