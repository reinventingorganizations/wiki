intro: Stimmungen beeinflussen Möglichkeiten. Das Thema Stimmungsmanagement
  fasst zusammen, wie mit Stimmungen in verschiedenen Arten von Organisationen
  umgegangen wird und wie wichtig es ist, Wege zu finden, wie Stimmungen, die
  die angestrebten Ergebnisse unterstützen, gefördert werden.
perspective: "Jede historische Phase hat eine andere Sichtweise auf das
  Stimmungsmanagement und andere Praktiken:


  #### Rote Organisationen


  \r

  \r

  In [roten Organisationen ](../red-organizations/)läuft das
  Stimmungsmanagement darauf hinaus, sich der Stimmung des (Stammes-)Häuptlings
  und seiner \"Familie\" zu unterwerfen. Sie beaufsichtigen die Untergebenen.
  Furcht und Unterwerfung bewahren die Organisation vor dem Zerfall.\ 


  #### Bernstein-Organisationen


  \r

  \r

  In [bernsteinfarbene Organisationen](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)
  \"weiß\" der Ranghöchste, was das Beste für die in der Hierarchie tiefer
  Stehenden ist. Diese Erwartungen werden über Rollen und Regeln gesteuert. Wer
  die Regeln befolgt, wird belohnt, wer sie nicht befolgt, wird bestraft. Die
  Menschen mögen diese Ordnung und Vorhersehbarkeit schätzen.


  #### Orange Organisationen


  \r

  \r

  In [orangenen Organisationen](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) geht es
  um geplante und effiziente Ergebnisse. Anreize werden in der Regel eingesetzt,
  um diese organisatorischen Ergebnisse zu erreichen. Sie sind so konzipiert,
  dass sie bestimmte Arten von Handlungen motivieren/belohnen, aber nicht
  unbedingt die damit verbundenen Gefühle oder Stimmungen.\ 


  #### Grüne Organisationen


  \r

  \r

  In [grünen Organisationen](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) werden
  Harmonie, Toleranz und Gleichheit geschätzt. Teams und ihre Gesundheit sind
  wichtig. Das Ziel ist es, die Motivation zu steigern. Die Personalabteilung
  kann mit Prozessen wie Kulturinitiativen, [360-Grad-Feedback]
  (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/360%C2%B0-Feedback) und Umfragen zur
  Mitarbeiterzufriedenheit arbeiten. Es wird nun bewusst auf die Stimmung
  geachtet. Es wird oft versucht, alle Bedürfnisse (oder Stimmungen) der
  Beteiligten zu befriedigen.


  #### Teal organizations


  * Mood Management is seen as integral and crucial to the creation of a space
  in which the intended outcomes can be achieved and the purpose of the
  organization served.

  * In [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)the
  combination of worthwhile purpose, self-direction and collaboration
  contributes to elevated mood.

  * There is no HR function charged with 'mood management'. It is up to
  individuals and groups to develop practices that enable them to work
  harmoniously.

  * These practices may depart - sometimes radically - from traditional
  organizations. New recruits may find this difficult at first.

  * The best practices tend to be adopted across the organization."

  #### The way mood management works


  [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) recognize that mood mediates what is possible; that it predisposes certain courses of action, and closes off others. In [self-managed](../self-management/) organizations people value both autonomy and collaboration in pursuit of purpose. The practice of shared processes supports this. Purpose and practice conspire to produce a sense of shared belonging, alignment and potency. This sense of potency supports [innovation](../innovation-and-product-development/). People have ideas, seek support from colleagues and, when they work, share the enjoyment of their wider acceptance. These successes give rise to stories and practices. These, combined with 'wholeness events' are two contributors to the mood in the organization.


  Both may be used within hierarchical systems, too: they don’t depend on self-managing structures. But in Teal organizations they are more likely to arise from the inspiration of its members and their [shared values](../culture-and-values/). They may arise naturally, find their place, become openly adopted, and treasured.


  ##### *Storytelling*


  The stories people tell themselves and others reflect and reinforce mood. They convey memorable instances of shared values at work. What mood do we wish to share, and celebrate? Playfulness? Concentration? Prudence? Joy? Pride? Care? Gratitude? Curiosity? Determination? If we are self-managed, this selection is likely to be different for different people.


  Gratitude is one of the most powerful moods. We are satisfied. We drop our search for more. In this moment, we feel fulfilled. From that fullness, other emotions naturally emerge. We experience joy and generosity; we treat others with care. To nurture this consciously we need to discover and/or design practices that evoke gratitude, or related moods.


  We can ask: What stories can we share that evoke the mood that serves us best? In this fashion, [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) may create storytelling practices that support and expand the mood of appreciation while strengthening trust among the members.


  Storytelling practices take many forms:


  * Starting meetings with each participant in turn sharing a brief story of someone they had recently thanked or congratulated. ([FAVI](http://www.favi.com/)) 

  * Coming back to work from a day off (which included the task of expressing gratitude to somebody important in one's life), and sharing the experience with colleagues. ([Ozvision](http://ozvision.com/))

  * The Friday afternoon “praise meeting” in a school: sharing stories of kindness, courage, care, or professionalism as key to the school’s exceptional learning culture. ([ESBZ](http://www.ev-schule-zentrum.de/aktuell/))

  * The “Good Stuff Friday” e-mail: Started by one of the colleagues and sent to the entire workforce thanking a colleague or department for something that happened that week, or simply to share some good news. It invariably triggers an avalanche of recognition. ([BerylHealth](http://www.berylhealth.com/))


  ##### *Wholeness Events*


  Moods are also created by shared experiences: especially if they are filled with laughter, joy, fun, creativity, a feeling of trust, authenticity, belonging, acceptance and recognition.


  Traditional organizations may sponsor events, too - typically by HR or the CEO, for team building or similar. However, in a [Teal organization](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) they usually emerge out of the organization itself. When people feel safe enough to take the initiative, it seems that these self-created and organized events emerge spontaneously. We long, deep inside, to be in all of our humanity: the funny and the quirky, as well as the serious and responsible.  Human connections emerge from these places.


  Wholeness Events can be all kinds of things, like:


  * The self-organized “Art Salon” where everyone is invited to share an artistic passion. Some display photographs and paintings. Others perform (songs, dances, juggling ...), and so on. If people really enjoy themselves, these can become regular institutions. ([Sounds True](http://www.soundstrue.com/)) 

  * Fun at breakfast by showing up in pajamas to celebrate spring: so much fun was had at the premiere of this that now 90% of staff join in the annual self-organized “Pajama Day”. It is a celebration of community, fun, and getting to know colleagues in a completely different way. ([Sounds True](http://www.soundstrue.com/))
faq:
  - question: In a company we need to make money to thrive! So why should we bother
      with moods?
    answer: >-
      We certainly need money to thrive in a business. Should the questions be:
      What else do we need? Does this get in the way of, or support, financial
      health? 


      Many (especially younger employees) are disillusioned with what they perceive as an excessive focus on money; especially when it manifests as greed. The result is a widespread disengagement evident in surveys by [Gallup ](http://www.gallup.com/services/169328/q12-employee-engagement.aspx)and others. 


      A motivating work environment fosters financial success. [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) offer this via more autonomy and more community in pursuit of worthwhile purpose. These are clear motivators. They elevate 'mood'; they foster engagement; which in turn can correlate with financial health.
  - question: Isn't it too personal to deal with staff's moods?
    answer: >-
      'To deal with' infers 'to manage by others'. In some styles of
      organization this has been via programs initiated by senior management or
      HR.


      In [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) the practices that support elevated mood are often initiated by members and have optional participation. If staff can 'manage' their own practices, then the risk of being 'too personal' diminishes. It is fair to say, however, that new staff--especially senior ones--can find the move to a mood-sensitive organization difficult. This is a choice to be explored carefully during joining discussions.


      If 'mood' determines the choices open to individuals, groups and organizations, it still ranks as an important consideration.
