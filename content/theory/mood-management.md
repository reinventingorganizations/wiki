intro: 情绪氛围直接影响潜力和可能性。情绪管理这一章概述了不同组织内如何处理情绪课题，如何找到很多做法，激励那些能带来期待产出的情绪，以及这些做法的实践效果。
perspective: >-
  人类组织在不同历史阶段，对情绪管理有不同见解和不同处理方式：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)mood management boils down to submission to the mood of the (tribal) chief and his “family”. They oversee the foot soldiers. Fear and submission keep the organization from disintegrating. 


  #### 琥珀组织


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)认为只有最高层“知道”部下的最佳利益。通过角色和规则管理这些被强加的愿景。奖赏那些遵守规则的人，惩罚那些不遵守规则的人。人们很看重这种秩序和可预见性。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，重视有计划有效率的结果。通常用激励措施来实现这些组织成果。目的只是激励/奖励某些行为，但不一定激励这些行为内隐含的情感或情绪。


  #### 绿色组织


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，和谐、宽容和平等受到重视。最受重视的是团队和社区健康。组织的目的是为了提高成员的积极性和动力。人力资源部会通过文化倡议、360度反馈和员工满意度调查等流程努力运作。开始有意识地关注情绪侧面。通常尝试尽可能满足所有利益相关者的需求（或情绪）。


  #### 蔚蓝组织


  * 蔚蓝组织认为情绪管理是融合剂，有助于打造良好的职场空间，能带来期待的产出成果，服务于组织目标。

  * 在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)把成员对目标价值的兴趣，促进自我导向和团结协作等要素组合起来，致力于提升情绪氛围。

  * 不设置情绪氛围管理专用的人力资源功能模块。由成员和小组全权负责，共同打造能让自己和谐工作的流程。

  * 这些流程与传统组织做法大相径庭，新人最初可能会发现难于适应。

  * 团队个别打造的一些被证明的最佳流程，会被整个组织接纳推广。

  #### 情绪管理的运作方式


  [蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)认识到，情绪氛围直接影响组织和成员的创造力和可能性；情绪会积累某些行为模式，并关闭其他可能性。在[自我管理](../self-management/)组织内，人们在重视主权单一运作的同时，还强调校准共同目标的协调运作。有各种共享式流程支撑这种协调运作。目标和路程有机组合，创造出一种共享的归属感、联盟感和潜力。这种力量感能支撑[创新](../innovation-and-product-development/)和发明创造。人们有各种想法时、能在同事中寻求支持，当这些想法带来成果时能共享自己想法得到更广泛认可的喜悦。这些成功会孕育出成功故事和更佳流程。这些与完整人性活动相结合，能增进组织内的情绪氛围。


  两者虽然也都可以用在传统金字塔阶梯系统内：但那都不是根基于自我管理结构。在蔚蓝组织内，这些都自然而然的来源于其成员的灵感及其[共享价值观](../culture-and-values/)。这些方法会自然出现，找到其合适的位置，被广泛的接纳并珍视。个体与集体和谐时，创造力会得到最大化。


  ##### *讲故事*


  人们通过讲给自己和他人的故事，能够投射并强化情绪氛围。故事能在工作中传递共识价值观的记忆场景。我们希望分享并欢迎何种情绪？游戏化？聚焦？谨慎？喜悦？傲慢？关怀？感恩？好奇心？勇气？如果我们实施自我管理，不同个体对这些的选择会各有不同。


  赞赏感恩是一种最有力量的情绪。我们得到满足感。我们放下追求更佳的贪婪。在这个当下，我们感觉到实现价值的喜悦。从这种完整感中（缺失感是传统情绪习惯），其他情绪会油然而生。我们会体验到喜悦和宽宏大量；我们会关怀其他人。为了有意识的滋养这种情绪，我们需要发现并（或）设计一些能催化赞赏感恩或类似情绪的流程和实践方法。（心之六美德，赞赏感恩，慈悲，理解，宽恕，谦卑，勇气）


  我们可以提问：我们要分享什么故事，才能用来催化那些带给我们最大益处的情绪？[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)可以打造一些讲故事方式的实践活动，来支撑并推广赞赏感恩情绪，同时也能增强同事间的信任。


  Storytelling practices take many forms:


  * Starting meetings with each participant in turn sharing a brief story of someone they had recently thanked or congratulated. ([FAVI](http://www.favi.com/)) 

  * Coming back to work from a day off (which included the task of expressing gratitude to somebody important in one's life), and sharing the experience with colleagues. ([Ozvision](http://ozvision.com/))

  * The Friday afternoon “praise meeting” in a school: sharing stories of kindness, courage, care, or professionalism as key to the school’s exceptional learning culture. ([ESBZ](http://www.ev-schule-zentrum.de/aktuell/))

  * The “Good Stuff Friday” e-mail: Started by one of the colleagues and sent to the entire workforce thanking a colleague or department for something that happened that week, or simply to share some good news. It invariably triggers an avalanche of recognition. ([BerylHealth](http://www.berylhealth.com/))


  ##### *Wholeness Events*


  Moods are also created by shared experiences: especially if they are filled with laughter, joy, fun, creativity, a feeling of trust, authenticity, belonging, acceptance and recognition.


  Traditional organizations may sponsor events, too - typically by HR or the CEO, for team building or similar. However, in a [Teal organization](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) they usually emerge out of the organization itself. When people feel safe enough to take the initiative, it seems that these self-created and organized events emerge spontaneously. We long, deep inside, to be in all of our humanity: the funny and the quirky, as well as the serious and responsible.  Human connections emerge from these places.


  Wholeness Events can be all kinds of things, like:


  * The self-organized “Art Salon” where everyone is invited to share an artistic passion. Some display photographs and paintings. Others perform (songs, dances, juggling ...), and so on. If people really enjoy themselves, these can become regular institutions. ([Sounds True](http://www.soundstrue.com/)) 

  * Fun at breakfast by showing up in pajamas to celebrate spring: so much fun was had at the premiere of this that now 90% of staff join in the annual self-organized “Pajama Day”. It is a celebration of community, fun, and getting to know colleagues in a completely different way. ([Sounds True](http://www.soundstrue.com/))
faq:
  - question: In a company we need to make money to thrive! So why should we bother
      with moods?
    answer: >-
      We certainly need money to thrive in a business. Should the questions be:
      What else do we need? Does this get in the way of, or support, financial
      health? 


      Many (especially younger employees) are disillusioned with what they perceive as an excessive focus on money; especially when it manifests as greed. The result is a widespread disengagement evident in surveys by [Gallup ](http://www.gallup.com/services/169328/q12-employee-engagement.aspx)and others. 


      A motivating work environment fosters financial success. [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) offer this via more autonomy and more community in pursuit of worthwhile purpose. These are clear motivators. They elevate 'mood'; they foster engagement; which in turn can correlate with financial health.
  - question: Isn't it too personal to deal with staff's moods?
    answer: >-
      'To deal with' infers 'to manage by others'. In some styles of
      organization this has been via programs initiated by senior management or
      HR.


      In [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) the practices that support elevated mood are often initiated by members and have optional participation. If staff can 'manage' their own practices, then the risk of being 'too personal' diminishes. It is fair to say, however, that new staff--especially senior ones--can find the move to a mood-sensitive organization difficult. This is a choice to be explored carefully during joining discussions.


      If 'mood' determines the choices open to individuals, groups and organizations, it still ranks as an important consideration.
