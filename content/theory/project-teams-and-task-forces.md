intro: 本文描述了跨职能团队如何产生和运作，以及他们的活动如何与组织设计的其余部分相适应。
perspective: >-
  在早期的组织阶段，项目团队和工作组都只能由有权突破严格的组织界限的上级管理层负责建立。通常会任命一名项目经理/团队领导，并根据能力、现有结构中的职位、忠诚度或与他人协作的能力等因素选择团队成员。项目经理指导团队成员的活动。当上级管理层认为已取得成果、或判定项目失败或无成功前景不再值得努力时，就决定解散该团队/任务组。


  蔚蓝组织中的项目团队和工作组具有以下特点：


  * 根据组织的进化目标自然出现和解散。不需要任何权威角色建立或任命。

  * 团队成员由认为项目很重要的（喜欢），同时愿意并能立即参与项目的人组成，选人标准不一定是“接受过最好教育或最有经验的人”。

  * 无某个人或工作组来“领导”或“管理”该项目。

  * 成员通常根据一个或多个这样的衡量标准来决定自己参与项目的优先级：什么是最重要的？最紧急？最有趣？（组织目标和个人爱好结合）

  #### 有机体形态


  在蔚蓝组织，不根据任何人的要求而创建项目团队或工作组。当许多人看到一种需要并愿意为此作出贡献时，项目就自然产生了。项目成员不是根据他们在组织中的能力或职位被任命。任何人都可以组建一个项目团队。如果没人能抽出时间来做这个项目，那么现在就有一种自然的集体决定，认为这内容可能并不重要。


  #### 目标驱动的活动


  在蔚蓝组织中，只要项目团队或任务组支持组织进化目标的特定部分，就能存在。当它没有支持组织目标就会枯萎、死亡，或者转变成另外一个新项目。团队成员根据他们认为最重要、最紧急或最有趣的事情来优先考虑自己是否参与。如果一个项目的创立者不能激励人们做出贡献，就应该扪心自问：我的项目是否符合组织的目标？是否另一个项目吸引了本来是我需要的人？如果是这样，我如何考虑让这两个项目相互支持？


  #### Radically simplified project management


  In Teal organizations, there are no project or program managers, no software systems or Gantt charts to organize or control the various projects underway. There is minimal project budgeting, no master plan and rarely a timeline. A huge amount of time is freed by dropping all the formalities of project planning— writing the plan, getting approval, reporting on progress, explaining variations, rescheduling, and re-estimating, not to mention the politics that go into securing resources for one’s project or to find someone to blame when projects are over time or over budget.^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  #### Fluid physical space


  In companies where Teal projects and task forces are standard, the architectural layout may be designed to support a fluid structure. The office at Sun Hydraulics is a big open space with custom-designed cubicles that go only waist high. At a glance, people can see who is there and can overhear many conversations. It greatly improves collaboration, colleagues say.


  At [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/hu/), a Seattle game developer, all employees have desks on wheels. They roll their desks around depending on the projects they join or leave. The company has even designed an intranet app so colleagues could locate each other easily. It displays an office map, in real-time, showing where people have plugged in their computers.^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 85-6]


  #### Task forces instead of formal staff departments


  In Teal companies, voluntary task forces are often used to perform tasks typically carried out by traditional staff departments. This has multiple benefits: Employees can find ways to express talents and gifts their primary role might not call for. They can develop areas of expertise that can then be shared with others in the organization. Task forces are also formidable learning opportunities; people pick up technical and leadership skills from more experienced colleagues in a modern-day form of apprenticeship.^\[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 90] See also Staff Functions
faq:
  - question: Doesn’t this lead to chaos?
    answer: Teal organizations trust the collective intelligence of the system.
      While this may seem risky or outright foolish, if we reflect on lessons
      learned in the domain of economics, we have reached a general consensus
      that the centralized planning committees of the Soviet Union were
      ineffective. While contemporary approaches to capitalism leave much to be
      desired, the free-market system where a myriad of players sense and
      respond to signals, make decisions, and coordinate among themselves has
      proven to be more flexible and responsive. This means, that things
      occasionally fall through the cracks, but this is often to be welcomed as
      the outcome of a collective prioritization effort; the system simply roots
      out a project that doesn't seem promising or important after all.^[Laloux,
      Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 85-6]
  - question: What about agile and lean?
    answer: 'Agile and lean can be naturally and deeply embedded in Teal project
      teams. [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) is an example: "The factory was an
      eager and early adopter of Japanese manufacturing techniques; it masters
      continuous improvement like few others, a critical capability to survive
      and thrive in the low-margin automotive business... A very simple process
      is at work: whenever a team stumbles upon a problem or an opportunity, as
      happens every day, the issue is logged in a logbook. Anybody can volunteer
      to tackle an item by writing his or her initials next to the issue in the
      logbook. Typically, the two or three people that are most affected or
      interested decide to join forces and analyze the issue. If no one picks up
      a certain problem or opportunity, it probably means it is not important.
      Otherwise, it will come up again, and someone will end up tackling it...
      no one bothers with statistics, master plans, project management software,
      or reporting. There is a simple reminder mechanism: operators have asked a
      woman working in administration to go through the logs once in awhile, and
      if there are items that have been open for more than three months, to
      remind people who have signed up to tackle the issue about their
      commitment. Teams have found this gentle prodding to be helpful."^[Laloux,
      Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 89]'
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      In Teal, project teams and task forces are self-organized and voluntary. They are not created by upper management or commanded by a team leader.


      #### Wholeness


      In Teal, people are not limited to a single role or job description. They can join teams and task forces that match their interests and talents and are encouraged to use both their rational and intuitive minds to prioritize which projects to join.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      Individuals and groups listen for what they sense is needed right now, and form project teams as required. Likewise, they trust, that if no one can find time to work on the project, it's because it's not important to the organization’s purpose right now.
