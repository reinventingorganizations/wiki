intro: "This article describes how cross functional teams emerge and operate,
  and how their activities fit with the rest of the organizational design.\r

  \r\n"
perspective: >-
  In earlier organizational stages, project teams and task forces are
  established by upper management to break through strict organizational
  boundaries. Typically a project manager/team leader is appointed, and team
  members are selected based on factors such as competency, position in the
  existing structure, loyalty or ability to work with others. The team leader
  directs the activities of the team members. Upper management decides to
  disband the team/task force when it deems results have been achieved, the
  project is a failure or the prospects for success are no longer worth the
  effort.


  Project teams and task forces in Teal organizations have the following characteristics:


  * They organically emerge and disband, depending on what the evolutionary purpose of the organization calls for at the time. They are not appointed by someone given authority to do so.

  * They are staffed with people who think the project is important, can and will attend to the project immediately, and are not necessarily the “best educated or best experienced persons for the job”.

  * There is no single person to “lead” the team or task force or “manage” the project.

  * Individuals prioritize their involvement in the project based on usually one or more of these measures: What is most important? Most urgent? Most fun?

  #### Organic formation


  In Teal, no one mandates the creation of a project team or task force. It is created when a number of people see a need and are willing to contribute to it. No one is appointed based on their competence or position in the organization. Anyone can start a project team. If no one can spare time for the project, there is a collective trust that it's probably not important right now.


  #### Purpose-driven activity


  In Teal, a project team or task force exists as long as it supports a specific part of the organization's evolutionary purpose. When it has - or if it doesn't - it withers and dies, or transforms into something new. Team members prioritize their involvement depending on what they sense is the most important, most urgent or most fun to do. If the creator of a project cannot motivate people to contribute, he should ask himself: Is my project aligned with the organization's purpose? Is another project attracting the people I need? If so, how can our two projects support each other?


  #### Radically simplified project management


  In Teal organizations, there are no project or program managers, no software systems or Gantt charts to organize or control the various projects underway. There is minimal project budgeting, no master plan and rarely a timeline. A huge amount of time is freed by dropping all the formalities of project planning— writing the plan, getting approval, reporting on progress, explaining variations, rescheduling, and re-estimating, not to mention the politics that go into securing resources for one’s project or to find someone to blame when projects are over time or over budget.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  #### Fluid physical space


  In companies where Teal projects and task forces are standard, the architectural layout may be designed to support a fluid structure. The office at Sun Hydraulics is a big open space with custom-designed cubicles that go only waist high. At a glance, people can see who is there and can overhear many conversations. It greatly improves collaboration, colleagues say.


  At [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/hu/), a Seattle game developer, all employees have desks on wheels. They roll their desks around depending on the projects they join or leave. The company has even designed an intranet app so colleagues could locate each other easily. It displays an office map, in real-time, showing where people have plugged in their computers.^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 85-6]


  #### Task forces instead of formal staff departments


  In Teal companies, voluntary task forces are often used to perform tasks typically carried out by traditional staff departments. This has multiple benefits: Employees can find ways to express talents and gifts their primary role might not call for. They can develop areas of expertise that can then be shared with others in the organization. Task forces are also formidable learning opportunities; people pick up technical and leadership skills from more experienced colleagues in a modern-day form of apprenticeship.^[Laloux, Frederic.

faq:
  - question: Doesn’t this lead to chaos?
    answer: Teal organizations trust the collective intelligence of the system.
      While this may seem risky or outright foolish, if we reflect on lessons
      learned in the domain of economics, we have reached a general consensus
      that the centralized planning committees of the Soviet Union were
      ineffective. While contemporary approaches to capitalism leave much to be
      desired, the free-market system where a myriad of players sense and
      respond to signals, make decisions, and coordinate among themselves has
      proven to be more flexible and responsive. This means, that things
      occasionally fall through the cracks, but this is often to be welcomed as
      the outcome of a collective prioritization effort; the system simply roots
      out a project that doesn't seem promising or important after all.^[Laloux,
      Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 85-6]
  - question: What about agile and lean?
    answer: 'Agile and lean can be naturally and deeply embedded in Teal project
      teams. [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) is an example: "The factory was an
      eager and early adopter of Japanese manufacturing techniques; it masters
      continuous improvement like few others, a critical capability to survive
      and thrive in the low-margin automotive business... A very simple process
      is at work: whenever a team stumbles upon a problem or an opportunity, as
      happens every day, the issue is logged in a logbook. Anybody can volunteer
      to tackle an item by writing his or her initials next to the issue in the
      logbook. Typically, the two or three people that are most affected or
      interested decide to join forces and analyze the issue. If no one picks up
      a certain problem or opportunity, it probably means it is not important.
      Otherwise, it will come up again, and someone will end up tackling it...
      no one bothers with statistics, master plans, project management software,
      or reporting. There is a simple reminder mechanism: operators have asked a
      woman working in administration to go through the logs once in awhile, and
      if there are items that have been open for more than three months, to
      remind people who have signed up to tackle the issue about their
      commitment. Teams have found this gentle prodding to be helpful."^[Laloux,
      Frederic. Reinventing Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 89]'
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      #### Self-management


      In Teal, project teams and task forces are self-organized and voluntary. They are not created by upper management or commanded by a team leader.


      #### Wholeness


      In Teal, people are not limited to a single role or job description. They can join teams and task forces that match their interests and talents and are encouraged to use both their rational and intuitive minds to prioritize which projects to join.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      Individuals and groups listen for what they sense is needed right now, and form project teams as required. Likewise, they trust, that if no one can find time to work on the project, it's because it's not important to the organization’s purpose right now.
