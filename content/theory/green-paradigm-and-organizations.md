  绿色组织对应着绿色意识阶段^\[这一阶段对应着洛文格和库克·格雷特的“个人主义”、托伯特的“个人主义”、韦德的“依附性”、格雷夫斯的“FS”、螺旋动力的“绿色”等说法；通常被简单地称为后现代主义。]，关键词是平等。在保持金字塔结构的同时，绿色组织注重通过授权提升动力，创造伟大的工作场所。他们超越了橙色聚焦少数股东的缺点，拥抱了所有利益相关者。家庭是最形象的隐喻。

  #### 绿色意识阶段


  绿色意识到了橙色的一些缺点：唯物主义、社会不平等以及和谐区氛围的丧失。绿色对人们的感受很敏感：认为所有的观点都值得尊重。寻求社区、协作和共识。个人在归属感角度积极努力，争取与每个人建立和谐的关系。


  在18世纪末和19世纪工业化国家里，出现了一个由绿色组织运作的小圈子，倡导废除奴隶制、妇女解放和民主。肯·威尔伯这样说：


  随着对理性和以世界为中心之道德观的转变，我们看到了现代解放运动的兴起……对所有人类都应该公平、正确和公正，不分种族、性别或信仰。


  ……在短短一百年的时间里，从1788年到1888年，奴隶制度……在每一个理性的工业社会都已经变得非法。在（早期的范式中）奴隶制是完全可以接受的，因为平等的尊严和价值并不能延伸到所有人身上，而仅仅延伸到自己部落的人身上。


  出于几乎相同的原因，我们将看到女权主义和妇女运动在文化范畴的兴起……民主也是一种全新的形式……我们都记得，在希腊“民主政体”中，三分之一的人是奴隶，而妇女和儿童实际上也等于是奴隶。^\[在历史上，我们经常会发现一些思想，比如古希腊的民主超前于他们的时代，意味着超前于当时人们的发展重心。为了繁荣，这些思想必须等待人类意识进化赶上来，并为其提供美国哲学家理查德·塔纳斯所说的正确的“文化子宫”：这里有个很大的问题是，为什么哥白尼革命，由哥白尼本人发起于16世纪，并且在17世纪初才得到开普勒和伽利略的继承？为什么要等到那时，哥白尼之前的许多人假设了日心宇宙和行星地球？有证据表明，在古希腊、印度和欧洲中世纪的伊斯兰文化中都有这样的说法。我认为，这个问题表明，一个重大的范式转变，不仅仅取决于一些额外的经验数据，也不仅仅取决于一个使用了新概念的出色新理论。意识转型其实依赖于一个更大的背景，因此如果一个潜在的强大思想种子，落在完全不同的土壤上。从这个咱新土壤中，这个有机体，这个新的概念框架，才可以在一个新的文化和历史的子宫或母体中成长为一个“概念”。Richard Tarnas和Dean Radin，“范式转变的时机The Timing of Paradigm Shifts,” Noetic Now, January 2012.]


  因此，在18世纪末和19世纪，一小部分精英塑造了深刻的西方思想。到了20世纪，参与人数在增长。虽然橙色在今天的商业和政治中占主导地位，但绿色在学术思考、非营利组织、社会工作和社区活动领域中非常普遍。


  从绿色角度来看，人际关系的价值高于结果。与其自上而下的做决定，绿色更喜欢协作式的、自下而上的过程，并试图让对立的观点达成共识。橙色美化果断。绿色要求领导者为被领导者服务。这种立场是高尚、慷慨和慈悲心。在持续的不平等和歧视环境中，除了追求以自我为中心的事业和成功，人的生活中产生了更多的需求（自由，快乐等）。


  然而，这个阶段还存在着一些矛盾点。试图平等的对待所有观点，就会有人滥用人们对不宽容想法的高尚容忍，因而令高尚者陷入困境。红色的自我中心主义，琥珀色的确定性，以及橙色，都认为这是绿色的理想主义（不现实）。绿色与规则的关系是模棱两可的：一方面，认为规则是武断和不公平的，但也知道废除这些规则是不切实际的。绿色是打破旧结构的一个范例，但在制定切实可行的替代方案角度，往往不那么有效。


  #### Breakthroughs and characteristics of Green organizations


  Green is uneasy with power and hierarchy. If it means that those at the top rule over those at the bottom, then let’s abolish hierarchy. Let’s give everybody the same power. Let workers own the company in equal shares and make decisions by consensus.


  Some have tried to create a future along these lines; like the cooperative movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; or in the communes in the 1960s. In hindsight, these extreme forms of egalitarianism proved not to be successful, on scale and over time.^\[In the corporate sector, worker cooperatives have failed to achieve any meaningful traction. The ones that prevail are often run on practices that are a combination of Orange and Green. One often-cited success story is Mondragon, a conglomerate of cooperatives based in a Basque town of the same name in Spain (around 250 companies, employing roughly 100,000 people, with a turnover of around €15 billion). All the cooperatives are fully employee-owned. Bosses are elected; wage differentials are smaller than elsewhere (but still significant, at up to 9:1 or more); temporary workers have no voting rights, creating a two-tiered community where some are more equal than others. In the educational sector, there have been several models of schools with no authority structures from adults over children, most notably the Summerhill School, a British boarding school founded in the 1920s. It practices a radical form of democracy, where students and adults have the same voting power, and lessons are not compulsory, among other differences. In the institutional sphere, many supranational bodies―the United Nations, European Union, and World Trade Organization, and others―have decision-making mechanisms at the highest level that are, at least partially, molded along Green principles such as democratic or unanimous voting of the different member countries and rotating chairmanship. These Green decision-making principles are difficult to uphold, and richer or more powerful countries demand and often end up receiving more voting powers (often even implicit if not explicit veto powers). The staff departments of these institutions are most often run as Amber Organizations.] Gaining consensus in large groups is inherently difficult.


  Yet Green has come up with its own organizational model, via three breakthroughs. Some of the most celebrated and successful companies of recent times―Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Ben & Jerry’s, The Container Store, to name a few—run on Green practices and culture.


  ##### Green breakthrough 1: Empowerment


  Green Organizations retain the meritocratic hierarchical structure of Orange, but push as many decisions as possible down to frontline workers. They can make far-reaching decisions without management approval.


  They are directly in touch with the many, smaller, day-to-day problems. They are trusted to devise better solutions than experts from far away. Ground teams at Southwest Airlines, for example, are empowered to seek creative solutions to passenger problems: their colleagues at most other airlines must follow the rule book.


  Making decentralization and empowerment work on a large scale is not easy. Managers are effectively asked to share power and control. To make it work, companies must clearly spell out the kind of leadership that they expect from senior and middle managers. Green leaders should not merely be dispassionate problem solvers (like in Orange); they should be servant leaders. They should listen to subordinates, empower them, motivate them, and develop them. Time and effort is invested in developing servant leaders:


  * Candidates for management are screened on their mindset and behavior: Are they ready to share power? Will they lead with humility? 

  * Green Organizations often invest large amounts in courses for newly promoted managers, to teach them the mindset and skills of servant leaders.

  * Managers are evaluated based on 360-degree feedback, to make bosses accountable to their subordinates.

  * In some companies, managers are not appointed from above, but from below: subordinates choose their boss, after interviewing prospective candidates.


  ##### Green breakthrough 2: Values-driven culture and inspirational purpose


  A strong, shared culture is the glue that keeps empowered organizations from falling apart. Frontline employees are trusted to make decisions, guided by shared values rather than by a thick book of policies.


  Some people become disillusioned with this, and scoff at the notion of shared values. This is because Orange Organizations increasingly feel obliged to follow the fad: they define a set of values, post them on walls and on-line, and then ignore them if that is more convenient for the bottom line. But where leadership genuinely plays by shared values, you encounter incredibly vibrant cultures in which employees feel appreciated and empowered. Results are often spectacular. Research suggests values-driven organizations can outperform peers by wide margins.^\[The first major study dates from 1992, when Harvard Business School professors John Kotter and James Heskett investigated this link in their book Corporate Culture and Performance. They established that companies with strong business cultures and empowered managers/employees outperformed other companies on revenue growth (by a factor of four), stock price increase (by a factor of eight) and increase in net income (by a factor of more than 700) during the 11 years considered in the research. A more recent study by Raj Sisodia, Jagh Sheth, and David B. Wolfe, in what is arguably a defining book for the Green organizational model―Firms of Endearment: How World-Class Companies Profit from Passion and Purpose―came to similar conclusions in 2007. The “firms of endearment” studied by the authors obtained a cumulative return to shareholders of 1,025 percent over the 10 years leading up to the research, as compared to 122 percent for the S&P 500. From a methodological point of view, these results should be taken with a grain of salt. There is an obvious selection bias, as only exceptional companies that one would expect to outperform their peers were handpicked into the sample. The benchmark of the S&P 500 wasn’t adjusted for industry, size, or other criteria. Furthermore, criteria other than the organization model, such as patents, innovative business models, and asset utilizations that could explain the superior result, were not filtered out. Raj Sisodia’s latest book, written with John Mackey, has a whole chapter with references of similar studies to which interested readers can refer. Any research trying to make such general claims as the superior outcome of one organizational model over another is bound to hit methodological discussions (and on a principled level, one could question shareholder return or growth as the primary metric to gauge success, as most of these studies do). Perhaps direct experience ultimately matters more than academic claims. Anyone who spends time in organizations such as Southwest Airlines or The Container Store will return convinced that empowered workers in values-driven companies will on average outperform their peers in more traditional settings.]


  Green Organizations may put inspirational purpose at the heart of what they do. Southwest doesn’t consider itself merely in the transportation business; it insists it is in the business of “freedom,” helping customers to go to places they couldn’t without Southwest’s low fares. Ben & Jerry’s is not just about ice cream, it’s about the earth and the environment too.


  In Orange Organizations, strategy and its execution are prime. In Green Organizations, culture is paramount. CEOs of Green Organizations claim that promoting culture and shared values is their primary task. This focus elevates human resources (HR) to a central role. The HR director is often an influential member of the senior team, and a counselor to the CEO. She heads a large staff orchestrating big investments into processes like training, culture initiatives, 360-degree feedback, succession planning and morale surveys.


  ##### Green breakthrough 3: Multiple stakeholder perspective


  Green Organizations insist that businesses have a responsibility not only to investors, but also to management, employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, society at large, and the environment. The role of leadership is to make the right trade-offs so that all stakeholders can thrive.


  This is in contrast with the Orange perspective that for-profit companies should operate with a shareholder perspective and that management’s primary obligation is to maximize profits for investors. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” is often invoked to explain how this benefits all stakeholders in the long run.


  While many large organizations today are required to publish a social responsibility report, Green Organizations consider social responsibility integral to how they do business. It is not a distracting obligation.


  Social responsibility provides the motivation to innovate and to become better corporate citizens. They work with suppliers in developing countries to improve working conditions and prevent child labor; they reduce their carbon footprint and use of water; they may recycle products and reduce packaging.


  Leaders in Green Organizations maintain that while the “stakeholder perspective” might mean higher costs in the short term, it will deliver benefits for all in the long run—including shareholders.


  ##### Family as the guiding metaphor


  The dominant metaphor in Green is the family. This contrasts with the ‘organization as a machine’ in Achievement Orange. When leaders of Green Organizations speak, you can’t fail to notice how frequently the metaphor comes up: employees are part of the same family, in it together, ready to help each other out, being there for one another.


  At Southwest, one of eight injunctions is to display “a servant’s heart”. In the Southwest Way it is for employees to “Embrace the SWA family.”


  DaVita, a leading operator of dialysis centers, that has implemented Green principles with great consistency.^\[The 2006 Stanford Business Case on DaVita is highly readable and a good resource for readers wanting to immerse themselves in a more detailed description of Green organizational principles and practices.]It uses another community metaphor, the Village, and calls its 41,000 employees citizens. Corporate headquarters is known as Casa DaVita, while Kent Thiry, the chairman and CEO is called Mayor of the Village. He is credited with having rescued the company from virtual bankruptcy in 1999 to its current success by virtue of the Green culture he brought about.


  #### The Shadow of Green


  Green is born from the movement away from Orange, in many ways specifically away from the shadow of Orange. At its peak, Green is communitarian, egalitarian and consensual.^\[Don Beck puts it this way: "Our science left us numb, without heart and soul, and with only the outer manifestations of success. The “good life” was measured only in materialistic terms. We discover that we have become alienated from ourselves, as well as from others. [...] the basic human being has been neglected. The focus shifts from personal achievement to group- and community-oriented goals and objectives—for GREEN, we are all one human family. GREEN begins by making peace with ourselves and then expands to looking at the dissonance and conflicts in society and wanting to make peace there, too, addressing the economic gaps and inequities created by ORANGE, and also by BLUE and by RED, to bring peace and brotherhood so we can all share equally. Gender roles are derigidified, glass ceilings opened, affirmative action plans are implemented, and social class distinctions blurred. Spirituality returns as a nondenominational, nonsectarian “unity.””]


  The accomplishments of Green are significant and can probably not be overstated. In the short time of it’s existence humanity has seen major change in the direction of a more humane society: the civil rights movement, the women’s liberation movement, the global drive for environmental protection, heightened awareness for the need to protect our ecosystems, health care reforms, improved awareness of marginalization of minority groups in society, and more are all examples of progress that would never have emerged without it.


  But as much as Green is a healthy counterbalance to Orange, and to some extent also the previous stages, it is also a stage that can rigidify too far into its own spectrum and display its very own shadow tendencies.


  ##### Relativism without boundaries


  Green is put in a dilemma when its benevolence and tolerance is abused by the same groups that Green wants to invite into equality on equal terms. Green shadow is forced to choose between accepting when non-tolerant Amber and Red abuses its tolerance or to acknowledge that not all worldviews have the same level of maturity and may need different levels of limitation.


  ##### Non-rational is better


  In an effort to distance itself from Orange (rational) views, Green shadow sees all non-rational value systems as preferable. Green has a romantic notion with ‘back to nature’. It often does not see how pre-rational worldviews are deeply limited and how different they are from post-rational Green worldviews.


  ##### Accidental sameness as an externality of pluralistic identity


  When Green’s strong inclusion drive becomes identity this causes a need for shared ideals as a prerequisite for group membership consideration.^\[The resulting attitude becomes protection of the unique sameness inside the organization. This couples with an implicit judgement and suspiciousness of outsiders as potential threats to the established culture. This typically does not manifest in explicit or outspoken criticism as Green often tries to avoid confrontation. Rather this is more often seen as a moral high ground of implicit “shoulds” and unspoken expectations of certain views and means of expressions that must be exhibited or agreed on for acceptance from insiders. Any lack of such views or expression is confirmation that non-acceptance is justified. Clare W Graves puts it this way: “Green brings into existence the sociocratic value system, in which emphasis is placed upon ‘getting along’, accepting the authority of the group or the majority, and seeking status from others. This ‘other directed’ individual believes he will find salvation in belonging and in participating with others in what they want him to do. While the individual has given up his dogmatism, he nevertheless rigidifies in a world of sociocentric thinking.”, for more see The Mean Green Hypothesis: Fact or Fiction, by Natasha Todorovic] When this “like me, like us” filter becomes more important to determine membership than if an individual is motivated and capable to contribute to the organization’s purpose this often causes three problems at the collective level: Limited choice of people, lack of diversity inside the organization and a limited ability to get things done.


  ##### Power and structure is the obstacle to equality


  Green shadow confuses power with structure. Nature is full of both structure and natural hierarchy. In an effort to eradicate ineaquality Green shadow often attempts to dismantle all hiearchy and structure. But removing all formal structure from an organization does not defuse power, it forces power underground into informal structures. When members of these informal structures are not elected by members of the whole group the individuals who have power don't need to answer to the whole group or organization. This reduces transparency about use of power and disjoints power from accountability.^\[The natural cause of differences of power and influence is rooted in the diversity in individual people. We all have different levels of abilities, experience, range of expression and when we use these they naturally result in exercise of our own personal power - which is genuinely different in strength and nature. Jo Freeman puts it this way: “The idea of ‘structurelessness’ does not prevent the formation of informal structures, but only formal ones. [...] Thus, ‘structurelessness’ becomes a way of masking power. An unstructured group always has an informal, or covert, structure. It is this informal structure, particularly in unstructured groups, which forms the basis for elites. An elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. Elites are not conspiracies.These friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. Because people are friends, usually sharing the same values and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved in these networks have more power in the group than those who don’t. For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities there needs to be explicit structure. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can only happen if they are formalised. A ‘Structurelessness’ organisation is impossible. We can only decide whether or not to have a formally or informally structured one. \[...] All groups create informal structures as a result of the interaction patterns among the members. Such informal structures can do very useful things. But only unstructured groups are totally governed by them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of ‘structurelessness’, there can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. Consequences: a) people listen to others because they like them, not because they say significant things. b) informal structures have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly influenced by the group.”, see The Tyranny of Structurelessness, by Jo Freeman for more.]Power can’t simply be wished away. Like the Hydra, if you cut off its head, another will pop up somewhere else.
