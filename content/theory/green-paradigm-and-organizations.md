  绿色组织对应着绿色意识阶段^\[这一阶段对应着洛文格和库克·格雷特的“个人主义”、托伯特的“个人主义”、韦德的“依附性”、格雷夫斯的“FS”、螺旋动力的“绿色”等说法；通常被简单地称为后现代主义。]，关键词是平等。在保持金字塔结构的同时，绿色组织注重通过授权提升动力，创造伟大的工作场所。他们超越了橙色聚焦少数股东的缺点，拥抱了所有利益相关者。家庭是最形象的隐喻。

  #### 绿色意识阶段


  绿色意识到了橙色的一些缺点：唯物主义、社会不平等以及和谐区氛围的丧失。绿色对人们的感受很敏感：认为所有的观点都值得尊重。寻求社区、协作和共识。个人在归属感角度积极努力，争取与每个人建立和谐的关系。


  在18世纪末和19世纪工业化国家里，出现了一个由绿色组织运作的小圈子，倡导废除奴隶制、妇女解放和民主。肯·威尔伯这样说：


  随着对理性和以世界为中心之道德观的转变，我们看到了现代解放运动的兴起……对所有人类都应该公平、正确和公正，不分种族、性别或信仰。


  ……在短短一百年的时间里，从1788年到1888年，奴隶制度……在每一个理性的工业社会都已经变得非法。在（早期的范式中）奴隶制是完全可以接受的，因为平等的尊严和价值并不能延伸到所有人身上，而仅仅延伸到自己部落的人身上。


  出于几乎相同的原因，我们将看到女权主义和妇女运动在文化范畴的兴起……民主也是一种全新的形式……我们都记得，在希腊“民主政体”中，三分之一的人是奴隶，而妇女和儿童实际上也等于是奴隶。^\[在历史上，我们经常会发现一些思想，比如古希腊的民主超前于他们的时代，意味着超前于当时人们的发展重心。为了繁荣，这些思想必须等待人类意识进化赶上来，并为其提供美国哲学家理查德·塔纳斯所说的正确的“文化子宫”：这里有个很大的问题是，为什么哥白尼革命，由哥白尼本人发起于16世纪，并且在17世纪初才得到开普勒和伽利略的继承？为什么要等到那时，哥白尼之前的许多人假设了日心宇宙和行星地球？有证据表明，在古希腊、印度和欧洲中世纪的伊斯兰文化中都有这样的说法。我认为，这个问题表明，一个重大的范式转变，不仅仅取决于一些额外的经验数据，也不仅仅取决于一个使用了新概念的出色新理论。意识转型其实依赖于一个更大的背景，因此如果一个潜在的强大思想种子，落在完全不同的土壤上。从这个咱新土壤中，这个有机体，这个新的概念框架，才可以在一个新的文化和历史的子宫或母体中成长为一个“概念”。Richard Tarnas和Dean Radin，“范式转变的时机The Timing of Paradigm Shifts,” Noetic Now, January 2012.]


  因此，在18世纪末和19世纪，一小部分精英塑造了深刻的西方思想。到了20世纪，参与人数在增长。虽然橙色在今天的商业和政治中占主导地位，但绿色在学术思考、非营利组织、社会工作和社区活动领域中非常普遍。


  从绿色角度来看，人际关系的价值高于结果。与其自上而下的做决定，绿色更喜欢协作式的、自下而上的过程，并试图让对立的观点达成共识。橙色美化果断。绿色要求领导者为被领导者服务。这种立场是高尚、慷慨和慈悲心。在持续的不平等和歧视环境中，除了追求以自我为中心的事业和成功，人的生活中产生了更多的需求（自由，快乐等）。


  然而，这个阶段还存在着一些矛盾点。试图平等的对待所有观点，就会有人滥用人们对不宽容想法的高尚容忍，因而令高尚者陷入困境。红色的自我中心主义，琥珀色的确定性，以及橙色，都认为这是绿色的理想主义（不现实）。绿色与规则的关系是模棱两可的：一方面，认为规则是武断和不公平的，但也知道废除这些规则是不切实际的。绿色是打破旧结构的一个范例，但在制定切实可行的替代方案角度，往往不那么有效。


  #### 绿色组织的突破与特点


  绿色意识对权力和等级制度感到不安。绿色认为，如果权力意味着上层统治着底层，那么就要废除等级制度。给每个人同样的权力。让工人平等地拥有公司，并通过协商一致作出决定。


  有些人试图沿着这些路线创造未来，比如19世纪末20世纪初的协作社运动，或60年代的公社运动（社会主义大锅饭）。事后看来，这些极端形式的平等主义在规模上和持续性上都不成功。^\[1在企业领域，工人合作社未能取得任何有意义的进展。当时流行的做法大多是橙色和绿色相结合的做法。一个经常被引用的成功案例是蒙德拉贡（Mondragon），这是一家总部位于西班牙巴斯克（Basque）一个同名城镇的合作社联合体（约250家公司，雇员约10万人，营业额约150亿欧元）。所有合作社都完全由雇员所有。老板是选举产生的；工资差距比其他地方小（但仍然高达9:1或更高）；临时工没有投票权，形成了一个两层社会，其中一些人比其他人更平等。2在教育领域，已经出现了几种摒弃了成人控制儿童的权威结构的学校模式，最著名的是夏山学校，这是一所创建于20世纪20年代的英国寄宿学校，实行激进的民主形式，学生和成人拥有同样的投票权，课程也不是强制性的必修课。3在普通机构领域，表现在许多超国家机构中——联合国、欧洲联盟和世界贸易组织以及其他机构——特点是都有最高一级的决策机制，这些机制至少部分地遵循绿色原则，如不同成员国的民主或一致投票以及轮值主席制。这些绿色平等决策的原则很难坚持，更富裕或更强大的国家会要求并往往最终获得了更多的投票权（通常强国拥有即使不是明确的也是隐含的否决权）。这些机构的人事部门通常作为一个组织运作.] 因在大群体中取得共识本身就很困难。


  然而，绿色已经完成了三个突破，提出了独自的组织模式。最近一些最著名和最成功的公司-星巴克，西南航空，本杰里，集装箱商店，都是绿色经营的做法和文化案例。


  ##### 绿色突破1：赋能/授权


  绿色组织保留了橙色的精英阶层结构，但尽可能将更多决策权下放到一线员工身上。一下成员可以在没有管理层批准的情况下，做出影响深远的决定。


  因基层能直接接触到许多更小的日常问题，所以相信自己能找出比远道而来的专家更好的解决办法。例如，西南航空的地面团队有权寻求解决乘客问题的创造性方法：相比之下，在大多数其他航空公司的同行都必须遵守一些限制创造力的规则。


  在大规模运作中，去中心下放权力和赋能并非易事。这要求管理者积极有效的分享权力和控制权。为了使授权发挥作用，公司必须明确定义到底期望高级和中级管理人员具备何种领导能力。绿色领导者不应该仅仅是（如橙色那样）冷静的问题解决者；他们应该是仆人式的领导者。他们应该倾听下属的意见，赋予他们权力，激励他们，发展他们。绿色组织将时间和精力投入到培养服务型领导者方面：


  * 筛选管理层候选人的思维方式和行为：他们准备好分享权力了吗？他们会谦卑吗？

  * 绿色组织通常会在新晋升的管理者培训课程上投入大量资金，辅导他们学会仆人式领导的思维方式和技能。

  * 为了赢得部下对上司的信任，管理者的评价一般基于360度的反馈。

  * 在一些公司里，经理不是上面任命，而是部下选举：部下面试潜在的候选人之后选择老板。


  ##### 价值观驱动的文化与目标共鸣


  一种被真正共享的强大文化，是保持赋能宗旨的组织不致分崩离析的粘合剂。之所以敢信任一线员工做决策，是因为遵循着共同的价值观，而不是靠一本厚厚的政策来约束。


  有些人感受不到这种力量，所以嘲笑共享价值观的概念。这是因为，橙色组织是处于义务追随潮流，才定义了一套形式主义的价值观，虽然张贴在墙上和网上，却在遇到更现实的底线问题时，选择忽略这些价值观。但是，当领导力能真正通过培育共同价值观而发挥作用时，就会体验到令人难以置信的充满活力的文化。在这种文化中，员工会感到被赞赏和授权。其结果往往是惊人的。研究表明，以价值观为导向的组织可以在很大量级上超越同行。^\[第一项主要研究始于1992年，当时哈佛商学院教授约翰·科特（John Kotter）和詹姆斯·赫斯科特（James Heskett）在其著作《企业文化与绩效》（Corporate Culture and Performance）中调查了这一联系。他们确定，在研究所覆盖的11年中，拥有强大商业文化和授权经理/员工的公司在收入增长（四倍）、股价增长（八倍）和净收入增长（700多倍）方面的表现，都优于其他公司。Raj Sisodia、Jagh Sheth和David B.Wolfe最近的一项研究，也在2007年得出了类似的结论，这本书可以说是绿色组织模式的定义性著作——《亲密的公司：世界级公司如何从激情和目标中获利》。作者所研究的这个“受人喜爱的公司”在研究开始前的10年里，获得了1025%的累计股东回报率，对比的标准普尔500指数为122%。从方法论的观点来看，这些结果遭到了半信半疑。反对者认为：这个研究存在着明显的选择偏差，因为手工挑选作为研究样本的公司，都是些人们期望中的，表现优于同行的优秀公司。标普500指数的基准也没有根据行业、规模或其他标准进行调整。此外，除了组织模式以外的参数，例如专利、创新商业模式和资产利用率等可以有助于这些公司卓越结果的其他要素，也没有被过滤掉。拉吉·西索迪亚与约翰·麦基合著的最新一本书，有一整章里有类似研究的参考资料，感兴趣的读者可以参考。任何试图提出一种组织模式优于另一种组织模式的一般性结果的研究，都必然会遭到方法论的攻击（在原则层面上，人们可能会质疑，大多数这类研究都按照股东回报或增长作为衡量成功的主要指标，这是否合适）。也许直接经验最终比学术主张更重要。任何在西南航空（southern Airlines）或集装箱商店（Container Store）等机构工作过的人都会相信，在价值观驱动的公司里，拥有权力的员工相比于在更传统的环境下的平均表现，会优于同行环境的成果。]


  Green Organizations may put inspirational purpose at the heart of what they do. Southwest doesn’t consider itself merely in the transportation business; it insists it is in the business of “freedom,” helping customers to go to places they couldn’t without Southwest’s low fares. Ben & Jerry’s is not just about ice cream, it’s about the earth and the environment too.


  In Orange Organizations, strategy and its execution are prime. In Green Organizations, culture is paramount. CEOs of Green Organizations claim that promoting culture and shared values is their primary task. This focus elevates human resources (HR) to a central role. The HR director is often an influential member of the senior team, and a counselor to the CEO. She heads a large staff orchestrating big investments into processes like training, culture initiatives, 360-degree feedback, succession planning and morale surveys.


  ##### Green breakthrough 3: Multiple stakeholder perspective


  Green Organizations insist that businesses have a responsibility not only to investors, but also to management, employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, society at large, and the environment. The role of leadership is to make the right trade-offs so that all stakeholders can thrive.


  This is in contrast with the Orange perspective that for-profit companies should operate with a shareholder perspective and that management’s primary obligation is to maximize profits for investors. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” is often invoked to explain how this benefits all stakeholders in the long run.


  While many large organizations today are required to publish a social responsibility report, Green Organizations consider social responsibility integral to how they do business. It is not a distracting obligation.


  Social responsibility provides the motivation to innovate and to become better corporate citizens. They work with suppliers in developing countries to improve working conditions and prevent child labor; they reduce their carbon footprint and use of water; they may recycle products and reduce packaging.


  Leaders in Green Organizations maintain that while the “stakeholder perspective” might mean higher costs in the short term, it will deliver benefits for all in the long run—including shareholders.


  ##### Family as the guiding metaphor


  The dominant metaphor in Green is the family. This contrasts with the ‘organization as a machine’ in Achievement Orange. When leaders of Green Organizations speak, you can’t fail to notice how frequently the metaphor comes up: employees are part of the same family, in it together, ready to help each other out, being there for one another.


  At Southwest, one of eight injunctions is to display “a servant’s heart”. In the Southwest Way it is for employees to “Embrace the SWA family.”


  DaVita, a leading operator of dialysis centers, that has implemented Green principles with great consistency.^\[The 2006 Stanford Business Case on DaVita is highly readable and a good resource for readers wanting to immerse themselves in a more detailed description of Green organizational principles and practices.]It uses another community metaphor, the Village, and calls its 41,000 employees citizens. Corporate headquarters is known as Casa DaVita, while Kent Thiry, the chairman and CEO is called Mayor of the Village. He is credited with having rescued the company from virtual bankruptcy in 1999 to its current success by virtue of the Green culture he brought about.


  #### The Shadow of Green


  Green is born from the movement away from Orange, in many ways specifically away from the shadow of Orange. At its peak, Green is communitarian, egalitarian and consensual.^\[Don Beck puts it this way: "Our science left us numb, without heart and soul, and with only the outer manifestations of success. The “good life” was measured only in materialistic terms. We discover that we have become alienated from ourselves, as well as from others. [...] the basic human being has been neglected. The focus shifts from personal achievement to group- and community-oriented goals and objectives—for GREEN, we are all one human family. GREEN begins by making peace with ourselves and then expands to looking at the dissonance and conflicts in society and wanting to make peace there, too, addressing the economic gaps and inequities created by ORANGE, and also by BLUE and by RED, to bring peace and brotherhood so we can all share equally. Gender roles are derigidified, glass ceilings opened, affirmative action plans are implemented, and social class distinctions blurred. Spirituality returns as a nondenominational, nonsectarian “unity.””]


  The accomplishments of Green are significant and can probably not be overstated. In the short time of it’s existence humanity has seen major change in the direction of a more humane society: the civil rights movement, the women’s liberation movement, the global drive for environmental protection, heightened awareness for the need to protect our ecosystems, health care reforms, improved awareness of marginalization of minority groups in society, and more are all examples of progress that would never have emerged without it.


  But as much as Green is a healthy counterbalance to Orange, and to some extent also the previous stages, it is also a stage that can rigidify too far into its own spectrum and display its very own shadow tendencies.


  ##### Relativism without boundaries


  Green is put in a dilemma when its benevolence and tolerance is abused by the same groups that Green wants to invite into equality on equal terms. Green shadow is forced to choose between accepting when non-tolerant Amber and Red abuses its tolerance or to acknowledge that not all worldviews have the same level of maturity and may need different levels of limitation.


  ##### Non-rational is better


  In an effort to distance itself from Orange (rational) views, Green shadow sees all non-rational value systems as preferable. Green has a romantic notion with ‘back to nature’. It often does not see how pre-rational worldviews are deeply limited and how different they are from post-rational Green worldviews.


  ##### Accidental sameness as an externality of pluralistic identity


  When Green’s strong inclusion drive becomes identity this causes a need for shared ideals as a prerequisite for group membership consideration.^\[The resulting attitude becomes protection of the unique sameness inside the organization. This couples with an implicit judgement and suspiciousness of outsiders as potential threats to the established culture. This typically does not manifest in explicit or outspoken criticism as Green often tries to avoid confrontation. Rather this is more often seen as a moral high ground of implicit “shoulds” and unspoken expectations of certain views and means of expressions that must be exhibited or agreed on for acceptance from insiders. Any lack of such views or expression is confirmation that non-acceptance is justified. Clare W Graves puts it this way: “Green brings into existence the sociocratic value system, in which emphasis is placed upon ‘getting along’, accepting the authority of the group or the majority, and seeking status from others. This ‘other directed’ individual believes he will find salvation in belonging and in participating with others in what they want him to do. While the individual has given up his dogmatism, he nevertheless rigidifies in a world of sociocentric thinking.”, for more see The Mean Green Hypothesis: Fact or Fiction, by Natasha Todorovic] When this “like me, like us” filter becomes more important to determine membership than if an individual is motivated and capable to contribute to the organization’s purpose this often causes three problems at the collective level: Limited choice of people, lack of diversity inside the organization and a limited ability to get things done.


  ##### Power and structure is the obstacle to equality


  Green shadow confuses power with structure. Nature is full of both structure and natural hierarchy. In an effort to eradicate ineaquality Green shadow often attempts to dismantle all hiearchy and structure. But removing all formal structure from an organization does not defuse power, it forces power underground into informal structures. When members of these informal structures are not elected by members of the whole group the individuals who have power don't need to answer to the whole group or organization. This reduces transparency about use of power and disjoints power from accountability.^\[The natural cause of differences of power and influence is rooted in the diversity in individual people. We all have different levels of abilities, experience, range of expression and when we use these they naturally result in exercise of our own personal power - which is genuinely different in strength and nature. Jo Freeman puts it this way: “The idea of ‘structurelessness’ does not prevent the formation of informal structures, but only formal ones. [...] Thus, ‘structurelessness’ becomes a way of masking power. An unstructured group always has an informal, or covert, structure. It is this informal structure, particularly in unstructured groups, which forms the basis for elites. An elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. Elites are not conspiracies.These friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. Because people are friends, usually sharing the same values and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved in these networks have more power in the group than those who don’t. For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities there needs to be explicit structure. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can only happen if they are formalised. A ‘Structurelessness’ organisation is impossible. We can only decide whether or not to have a formally or informally structured one. \[...] All groups create informal structures as a result of the interaction patterns among the members. Such informal structures can do very useful things. But only unstructured groups are totally governed by them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of ‘structurelessness’, there can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. Consequences: a) people listen to others because they like them, not because they say significant things. b) informal structures have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly influenced by the group.”, see The Tyranny of Structurelessness, by Jo Freeman for more.]Power can’t simply be wished away. Like the Hydra, if you cut off its head, another will pop up somewhere else.
