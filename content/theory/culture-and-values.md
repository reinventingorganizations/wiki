  蔚蓝组织将共享的价值观推向了新阶段。针对组织内可接纳与不可接纳的言行，定义了清晰的基本规则或共识信念。多数蔚蓝组织都在招聘流程上投入大量时间，向应聘者传达组织的价值观，让他们有机会判断这些内容是否适配于自己理想中的未来图景。蔚蓝组织会频繁的审查和质疑公司的文化和价值观，以确保这些内容真正鲜活在组织成员的生活中。常见的鲜活的蔚蓝价值观包括：信任、透明、集体智慧、完整人性和主权。


  处于每个不同历史阶段的组织，都孕育出对文化和价值观各不相同的见解，以及完全不同的实践流程：


  ##### 红色组织


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，领导者通常表现出以自我为中心的行为，这些行为被他们对权力和控制的个人需求驱动着。他们常常很冲动、想方设法发挥自己的支配地位。这创造了一种恐惧、控制、甘冒风险和顺从的文化。团队的紧密关系通常是靠这些要素来维持。


  ##### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/),中，很重视稳定性和对集团规范的尊重。琥珀的领袖寻求秩序、稳定和可预测性。人们对变化持怀疑态度。通过结构化和官僚机构来维持控制。这些都培育一种从众文化。最重要的是做正确的事，并符合组织规范。重点考虑一个人是否有正确的外表、行为和思想。社会稳定的代价是人人都戴上伪装面具。人们可能会远离自己独特的本性、个人欲望、需求和感受，不得不包装并培育一个社会可以接受的自我形象。这种世界观的阴暗面是，工人们通常被视为懒惰、不诚实、需要指导。为确保工作得到妥善开展，管理和监督被认为是理所当然。


  ##### 橙色组织


  在[橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，基本价值观是成功、创新、有用、竞争/胜利、利润和认可。这是拜金的唯物主义世界观，理性受到高度重视。只有物质层面看得见摸得着的事物才是真的。组织的隐喻是一台“机器”。认为文化可以变得高度专业化、理性化，有时甚至不需要灵魂。只要有助于提高绩效，就欢迎变革。为了加快创新和变革，重视并鼓励跨组织合作。重视战略管理，注重成果而不是实现过程。个人能力、成果和成就受到重视和激励。职位提升是基于实际功绩而不是社会阶级或地位。


  ##### 绿色组织


  在[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，有时会以牺牲效率或成果为代价换取和谐的关系。组织的共同价值观是社区、沟通、协作、共识、和谐、宽容、正直、尊重、开放和平等。重视在授权基础上创造伟大的职场文化，以提高员工的积极性。虽然绿色组织通常建立在传统的等级模型和结构之上，但这种文化并不喜欢权力和等级制度。采用参与式和服务式领导方法，其价值在于促进自下而上的协作过程，发展共同的价值观，以及一种让人们感到受到重视和有权作出贡献的文化。橙色模式的主流比喻是“家庭”。橙色组织经常把自己的价值观作为一种口头上的营销宣传但没有渗透，绿色组织则真正的拥抱了价值观并以此为生活指南。


  ##### Teal organizations


  [蔚蓝组织 ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)致力于创建高效的组织，激励人们在工作中做一个或成长为一个完整的人。蔚蓝组织的文化，不是根据创立者和领导者的个人假设、规范和关切来塑造，而是根据组织的特定背景和[目标](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/theory/evolutionary-purpose/)而自然呈现出来。对蔚蓝组织的隐喻是“有生命的系统”。因此，组织应该具有自己的、可以随着时间推移而发展的自主身份和文化。文化和价值观跟结构与过程有机的结合在了一起。

  #### Establishing values and ground rules


  ##### *Defining a set of values*


  Many organizations find it helpful to define a set of values. In [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/), those values, together with [purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/), are at the very core of the organization' s culture, influencing most behaviors and processes. Those values often stem from the founder's vision, and are typically collectively defined. Values and related ground rules are not fixed, they are openly discussed and amended so that they remain a faithful reflection of what people in the organization live and believe in. Some organizations set out a simple set of common beliefs, or assumptions about human endeavor and behavior.


  ##### *Ground rules for safe space*


  To show up fully in the presence of others, as [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)encourage, people need to feel it is safe to do so. Having a defined set of values translated into clear "ground rules", when necessary, helps to do this.


  Some examples are: [RHD](http://www.rhd.org/)’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/)’s Colleague Principles, [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/)'s fiches or [Holacracy](http://www.holacracy.org/)'s Constitution. These documents provide a vision for a safe and productive workplace. They give colleagues a vocabulary to discuss healthy relationships, and they draw lines that separate recommended from unacceptable behaviors.


  Some startups find it important to draft a full version of such a document early on. Others will develop one as they grow. Organizations make sure they are written collectively so that they are full owned by all the people.


  #### Bringing values to life


  [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) understand it takes more than a plaque on the wall to bring values and ground rules to life. They spend a significant amount of time and energy on training and involving everyone in a continuous process of revisiting them. Some examples of keeping values alive are:


  * Values Training: once the new recruits are onboard, they are trained in the set of values and ground rules. 

  * Values Day or regular events: once a year, a festive event is organized where everybody is invited to revisit the organization's purpose, values and ground rules. 

  * Values meeting: every month or so, a meeting will take place where colleagues are invited to bring up issues with values and ground rules in the workplace and suggest changes. Values can also be discussed during Large Group Reflections.

  * Values survey: cultivating discussions around values can be supported by an annual survey.


  #### Culture and value-based recruitment


  [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) understand that a person's attitude and behaviors are as important as their skills. Therefore significant energy is devoted to finding people that fit with the organization's culture and values. New recruits are carefully interviewed to ensure they can thrive in the environment. It is a two way discovery processes aiming at finding out if the organization and individual are meant to “journey together”. 


  ### Values for the three Teal breakthroughs


  The principles and practices outlines above support the three breakthroughs of [self-management](../self-management/), [wholeness ](../wholeness/)and [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). 


  #### Self-management


  Self-managing structures transcend the issue of culture versus systems. Inner and outer dimensions, culture and systems, work hand in hand, not in opposite directions. The following are some examples of the types of values/principles that support self-management:


  * **Trust:** Teal practices are based on trust. Meet people with trust and they will respond with trust. Trust enables people to be fully responsible. It also lowers the need for hierarchy and control and enables [self-management](../self-management/). 

  * **Transparency:** When people have access to business information, often held by management, they can act and take decisions that are good for the whole. When there is transparency and openness collective intelligence is available to all. Sensitive information can be shared because everyone is able and trusted to handle difficult news. 

  * **Responsibility and accountability:** Everyone has a responsibility to the organization for sensing issues or opportunities and addressing them. People are expected to be comfortable with holding each other accountable for their [commitments](../commitment-working-hours-and-flexibility/), through [feedback](../feedback-and-performance-management/) and respectful confrontation.


  #### Wholeness


  Teal organizations seek a workplace that honors the humanness of the people who work there. The following are examples of the types of values/principles that support wholeness:


  * **Equal worth:** All people are of equal worth and at the same time different. Community will be richest when members are able to contribute in their distinctive way, whilst appreciating their differences. 

  * **Safe and caring workplace:** Situations are approached from love and connection rather than fear and separation. Creating a safe environment where everyone can behave authentically is essential. 

  * **Overcoming separation:**  All people are connected. We aim to create a workplace where cognitive, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects are be honored and valued. 

  * **Relationships and conflict:** It is impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves. We take ownership of our thoughts, beliefs, words and actions. We don’t spread rumors. We don’t talk behind someone’s back. We don’t blame problems on others.


  #### Evolutionary purpose


  Listening deeply to both the organization and to ourselves is essential in finding[ evolutionary purpose.](../evolutionary-purpose/) The following  are examples of the types of values/principles that support evolutionary purpose:


  * **Collective purpose:** We view the organization as having a soul and [purpose ](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/theory/listening-to-purpose/)of its own. We try to listen in to where the organization wants to go and beware of forcing a direction onto it. 

  * **Individual purpose:** We have a duty to ourselves and to the organization to inquire into our personal sense of calling to see if and how it resonates with the organization’s purpose. We try to imbue our roles with our souls, not our egos. 

  * **Planning the future:** Trying to predict and control the future is futile. We make forecasts only when a specific decision requires us to do so. Everything will unfold with more grace if we stop trying to control and instead choose to simply sense and respond. 

  * **Purpose and Profit:** In the long run, there are no trade- offs between purpose and profits. If we focus on purpose, profits will follow.
faq:
  - question: Do you need to change your set of values and ground rules when you
      transition to Teal?
    answer: Not necessarily. If your values are consistent with your purpose and if
      those values truly define who you are as an organisation, it is better for
      you to keep them. Maybe the ground rules will need to be readapted to
      better fit the [self-management
      ](https://reinventingorganizations-wiki.netlify.app/theory/self-management/)structure
      and processes. In any case you need to set up a process where those values
      and ground rules can be regularly and collectively reviewed to ensure you
      keep on living them.
