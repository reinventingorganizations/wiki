  ### A brief history of developmental models


  A great number of scholars and thinkers―historians, anthropologists,
  philosophers, mystics, psychologists, and neuroscientists―have delved into the
  question: *how has humanity evolved from the earliest forms of human
  consciousness to the complex consciousness of modern times?* Some inquired
  into a related question: *how do we human beings evolve today from the
  comparatively simple form of consciousness we have at birth to the full extent
  of adult maturity?*


  People have looked at these questions from every possible angle. Abraham
  Maslow  looked at how human needs evolve along the human journey, from basic
  physiological needs to self-actualization. Others looked at development
  through the lenses of *worldviews* (Gebser, among others), *cognitive
  capacities* (Piaget), *values* (Graves), *moral development* (Kohlberg,
  Gilligan), *self-identity* (Loevinger), *spirituality* (Fowler), *leadership*
  (Cook-Greuter, Kegan, Torbert), and so on.


  In their exploration, they found consistently that humanity and human beings
  evolve in stages. They do not evolve in the way that trees grow, continuously,
  but rather by sudden transformations, like a caterpillar that becomes a
  butterfly, or a tadpole a frog.


  Our knowledge about the stages of human development is now extremely robust.
  Two thinkers in particular―Ken Wilber^\\[For an easy introduction: Wilber,
  Ken. A brief history of everything. Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1996. For
  a more complete overview: Wilber, Ken. Integral Psychology. Boston: Shambhala
  Publications, 2000. ] and Jenny Wade^\\[Wade, Jenny. Changes of Mind: A
  Holonomic Theory of the Evolution of Consciousness. Albany: State University
  of New York Press, 1996.]―have done substantial work comparing and contrasting
  all the major stage models and have discovered strong convergence. Each model
  might look at a particular side of the mountain (one looks at needs, another
  at cognition, for instance), but it seems to be the same mountain. While they
  often choose different names to refer to the stages or sometimes subdivide or
  regroup stages differently, the underlying phenomenon is the same - just like
  Fahrenheit and Celsius recognize, with different labels, that there is a point
  at which water freezes and another where it boils. This developmental view has
  been backed up by solid evidence from large pools of data; academics like Jane
  Loevinger, Susanne Cook-Greuter, Bill Torbert, and Robert Kegan have tested
  this stage theory with thousands and thousands of people in several cultures,
  in organizational and corporate settings, among others.^\\[Laloux, Frederic

  Every transition to a new stage of consciousness has ushered in a new era in
  human history. At each juncture, everything changed: society (going from
  family bands to tribes to empires to nation states); the economy (from
  foraging to horticulture, agriculture, and industrialization); the power
  structures; the role of religion. One aspect hasn’t yet received much
  attention: with every new stage in human consciousness also came a
  breakthrough in our ability to collaborate, bringing about a new
  organizational model. Organizations as we know them today are simply the
  expression of our current worldview, our current stage of development. Every
  time that we, as a species, have changed the way we think about the world, we
  have come up with more powerful types of organizations.^\\[Laloux, Frederic

  Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 476-506).

  This wiki is based largely on the work of Frederic Laloux in *Reinventing
  Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of
  Human Consciousness*. In his work, Laloux attempts to catalog the stages
  through which human organizational development has progressed. He portrays
  these stages in a way that borrows from many researchers, including those
  mentioned above, but particularly from the meta-analyses of Ken Wilber and
  Jenny Wade. As in Wilber’s *Integral Theory*, Laloux’s work and this wiki give
  colors as names to each stage of development. It should be noted that while
  the descriptions of stages here are generally compatible with *Integral
  Theory*, they may not always correspond exactly.


  ### Some caveats


  Experience shows that some people react in two extreme ways when confronted
  with this developmental theory.


  * Some are so fascinated with these insights that they tend to apply them
  haphazardly, oversimplifying reality to fit the model.

  * Others have the opposite reaction; they feel so uncomfortable with a model
  that could be used to label people and put them into different boxes that they
  reject the notion there is a developmental aspect to human evolution. They see
  the notion of such stages as elitist and implying that certain people are
  somehow better than others.


  #### One stage is not necessarily \"better\" than the other


  First, there is no wishing away the massive evidence that backs the view
  that human consciousness evolves in stages. The problem is not with the
  reality of the stages; it is with how we view the staircase. We get into
  trouble when we believe that later stages are “better” than earlier stages; a
  more helpful interpretation is that they are “more complex” ways of dealing
  with the world. For instance, a person operating from Pluralistic-Green can
  integrate people’s conflicting perspectives in a way that a person operating
  from Impulsive-Red most likely cannot. At the same time, every level has its
  own light and shadow, its own healthy and unhealthy expressions. Orange
  modernity, for instance, for all the life-enhancing advancements it has
  brought, has changed the planet in a way previous stages never could.\r

  \r

  Another way to avoid attaching judgment to stages is to recognize that each
  stage is well adapted to certain contexts. If we were caught in a civil war
  with thugs attacking our house, Impulsive-Red would be the most appropriate
  paradigm to think and act from to defend ourselves. On the other hand, in
  peaceful times in post-industrial societies, Red is not as functional as some
  of the later stages.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing
  Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of
  Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 996-1004). Nelson Parker. Kindle
  Edition.]\r


  #### The map is not the territory\r


  Second, any developmental theory is only an abstraction of reality, just
  like a geographical map is only a simplified depiction of a territory; it
  gives us distinctions that facilitate understanding of a complex underlying
  reality, but it cannot claim to offer a full portrayal of reality. The key is
  to hold these models as useful orientations that can help us get a richer
  appreciation of the extraordinary complexity of life.\r

  \r

  Research shows that people (or even whole societies) do not operate neatly
  from just one paradigm. Humans are wonderfully complex and cannot be reduced
  to a single stage:\r

  \r

  * Every stage includes and transcends the previous. So if we have learned to
  operate from, say, Achievement-Orange, we still have the ability, when
  appropriate, to react from Conformist-Amber or Impulsive-Red. Even the
  opposite is true to some extent: were we to be surrounded by people operating
  from a later stage, for example, Pluralistic-Green, we could temporarily
  display Green behaviors, even though we wouldn’t yet have integrated this
  stage.\r

  * There are many dimensions of human development— cognitive, moral,
  psychological, social, spiritual, and so on— and we don’t necessarily grow at
  the same pace in all of them. For example, we might have internalized Orange
  cognition and be running an innovative business, but on the spiritual side, we
  espouse an Amber Christian fundamentalist belief.^[Laloux, Frederic
  (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations
  Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Location 1009-1016).
  Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]\r


  Similarly, one must apply development theory carefully with organizations.
  Few, if any, organizations fall neatly into just one stage. But if we look at
  an organization’s structure, its practices, and its cultural elements, we can
  generally discern what worldview they stem from. Let’s take the topic of
  compensation to illustrate this:\r

  \r

  * If the boss can freely, on a whim, decide to increase or reduce pay, that
  would be consistent with the Red paradigm.\r

  * If salaries are fixed and determined by the person’s level in the
  hierarchy (or the person’s diploma), that sounds in line with an Amber
  perspective.\r

  * A system that stresses individual incentives if people reach predetermined
  targets probably stems from an Orange worldview.\r

  * A focus on team bonuses would be in line with a Green perspective.\r


  When one looks through this filter not only at compensation, but at all the
  structure, practices, and culture of an organization, one generally finds that
  they are not scattered randomly among the stages and colors, but cluster
  around a center of gravity, a stage that defines most practices of the
  organization.


  ### The role of leadership\r


  What determines which stage an organization operates from? To date, the
  answer has been - the stage through which its leadership tends to look at the
  world . Consciously or unconsciously, leaders put in place organizational
  structures, practices, and cultures that make sense to them, that correspond
  to their way of dealing with the world.\r

  \r

  This means that organizations to date have not been able to evolve beyond
  its leadership’s stage of development. The practice of defining a set of
  shared values and a mission statement provides a good illustration. Because
  this practice is in good currency, leaders in Orange Organizations
  increasingly feel obliged to have a task force come up with some values and a
  mission statement. But looking to values and mission statements to inform
  decisions only makes sense as of the Green paradigm. In Orange, the yardstick
  for decisions is success: Let’s go with what will deliver top- or bottom-line
  results. In Orange organization’s, leadership might pay lip service to the
  values; but when the rubber hits the road and leaders have to choose between
  profits and values, they will predictably go for the former. They cannot
  uphold a practice and a culture (in this case, a values-driven culture) that
  stems from a later stage of development.\r

  \r

  The pull of leaders toward their stage of consciousness goes in two
  directions: they can pull “back” practices from later stages (rendering them
  ineffective as in the previous example), but they can also exert a strong pull
  “forward.” The structure, practices, and culture they put in place can help
  employees adopt behaviors of more complex paradigms that they as individuals
  have not yet fully integrated.\r

  \r

  Suppose I am a middle manager looking at the world mostly from a Amber
  perspective. My natural style with my subordinates would be to interact in
  very hierarchical ways, telling them exactly what they need to do and how they
  need to do it. Now let’s say I work in a Green Organization, where my leaders
  urge me to empower employees that work for me. All around me I see other
  managers giving their subordinates lots of leeway. Twice a year, I receive
  360-degree feedback, including from my direct reports, telling me how well I’m
  doing on empowerment (which can affect my bonus); every six months, I’m asked
  to sit down with my team and discuss how well we are doing in living company
  values (which include empowerment). Within such a strong context of Green
  culture and practices, I’m likely to espouse some Green management skills and
  behaviors. The context has pulled me up, leading me to operate in more complex
  ways than I would if left to my own devices. And just perhaps, over time, when
  I’m ready for it, the context will help me grow and genuinely integrate into
  that paradigm.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A
  Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human
  Consciousness (Kindle Location 1068-1076). Nelson Parker. Kindle Edition.]\r

  \r

  Having said this, it is important to note the concept of “leadership” is
  different in Teal. While earlier stages of organizational development relied
  fundamentally on a hierarchical power structure, with someone clearly “in
  charge”, Teal rejects the notion of a fixed hierarchy. The Teal organization
  is self-organizing and self-managing.\r

  \r

  Ironically, at the foundation of a Teal organization there is commonly a
  strong leader who, sensing the potential, initiates the sharing of power:
  Jean-Francois Zobrist at FAVI, Chris Rufer at Morning Star, and Jos de Blok at
  Buurtzorg are good examples.\r

  \r

  They imagined a different kind of organization, and a different kind of
  leadership: a leadership that is distributed, emergent and unpredictable.
  Anyone can lead—subject to an advice process—based on opportunity,
  circumstance and/or imagination.\r

  \r

  One might argue that the reason “leaders” have played such an important role
  in Teal organizations to date is because these organizations (and we as a
  civilization) are making a transition from earlier stages reliant on the
  traditional type of leader. Perhaps in the not too distant future, Teal
  organizations will fully and truly emerge without assistance from a single or
  small group of enlightened individuals.
