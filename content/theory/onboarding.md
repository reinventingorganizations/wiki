  The topic of onboarding describes how new colleagues are welcomed and
  supported when they join an organization. It covers training activities and
  rotation programs to help new joiners integrate successfully into the
  organizational and its culture.

  [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) invest significant
  time in welcoming and training new colleagues. This often includes learning
  new relational skills, understanding what self-management means in practice
  and going through a rotation program. These programs teach common skills and
  provide an opportunity for new colleagues to meet a wide range of people.

  Every historical stage has given birth to a distinct perspective on onboarding, and to very different practices:


  #### **Red Organizations**


  In [Red organizations](../red-organizations/) leaders continually exercise their power in order to maintain control. They often surround themselves with family members and trusted advisers, buying their allegiance by sharing the spoils. The onboarding process typically involves a ritual of allegiance to the leader. Mythical stories of the leaders power make the rounds and are part of the onboarding process.


  #### **Amber Organizations**


  [Amber organizations](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/) value order and predictability. Everybody has their place in a hierarchy which has clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Onboarding is about learning the requirements of the role and the expectations that come with it. This often means putting personal needs and feelings aside in favor of the organization. People are expected to follow the rules and stay in their ‘box’.


  #### **Orange Organizations**


  [Orange organizations](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) are characterized by competition and achievement drive. Innovation is the key to staying ahead. The onboarding process is often functional.. People might receive a few brochures about the company’s history, mission statement and values, or there might be a two-hour session where a senior leader talks about these topics. But mostly, the first steps are often mundane: there are papers to sign, a desk and computer to find, and a password to be assigned in order to access the firm’s network. Once ready to go, the new employee must try to create some time in his supervisor’s agenda to get some guidance on what to do.


  #### **Green Organizations**


  [Green Organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) focus on culture and empowerment to encourage employee motivation. Teaching the approach and skills of servant leadership is a significant aspect of onboarding for managers. Managers, in turn, play an important role in welcoming newcomers into the organization and helping them understand the culture. Onboarding is often about community building and meeting the new family in an open way.


  #### **Teal Organizations**


  [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) invest significant time in welcoming and training new colleagues. This often includes learning new relational skills, understanding what self-management means in practice and going through a rotation program. These programs teach common skills and provide an opportunity for new colleagues to meet a wide range of people. Newcomers are also  introduced to the practices of [self-management](../self-management/), [wholeness](../wholeness/) and  [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/) They are invited to consider their calling and talents in relation to the organization's purpose and its activities.

  #### **Training in relational skills and in company culture**


  [Teal Organizations Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) invest significant time and energy welcoming new colleagues. The first days and weeks are critical to helping them understand a new and often very different workplace. At the heart of the onboarding process is some form of training that helps colleagues understand and navigate the new environment they joined.


  At Buurtzorg, for example, all new team members are trained in problem solving and meeting practices, so they can operate in a team without a boss in charge. All new hires at [Heiligenfeld](http://www.heiligenfeld.com/) go through six training modules that include topics like "self-mastery" and "dealing with failure". All new recruits at [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/) attend a seminar on the basics of [self-management](../self-management/).


  For people who were previously in leadership positions, the transition can be particularly difficult. They have to learn how to get things done without recourse to command and control.


  A significant part of the onboarding process is often dedicated to understanding the concept of [Evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). New employees are encouraged to express their personal calling to see how it resonates with the organization' s purpose and to learn how they might support and nurture each other.


  There is no perfect recipe for a Teal onboarding process. Each organization chooses a range of activities that aim to teach new skills and, in the process, touch the heart and soul of those joining. A good way to develop an onboarding process is to ask employees, especially new ones, to co-create their own onboarding program and activities.


  Foundational training in some of the following practices helps new colleagues starting in a Teal organization.


  #### **Ground rules or agreements**


  Creating a safe workplace starts with raising everybody’s awareness of the words and actions that create or undermine a safe working environment. Teal organizations spend significant time and energy training everybody in a number of ground rules or agreements that support healthy and productive collaboration. These ground rules are a tangible application of the [culture and values](../culture-and-values/) of the organization. Several of the organizations end up writing down these in a document.


  Of course, it takes more than a document to bring values to life. Many researched Teal organizations have chosen to start right at the beginning: all new recruits are invited, as part of the onboarding, to a training session about the company values and ground rules, which helps to create common references and a common language across the organization. Those ground rules and values are regularly revisited to ensure they best reflect and serve the Evolutionary purpose of the organization.


  #### **Purpose**


  A dialogue on how the organization's purpose resonates with new colleagues personal calling can be a great mutual introduction. [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) are seen as having a life and a sense of direction of their own. Instead of trying to predict and control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen in and understand what the organization wants to become. By understanding the Evolutionary purpose, they can see how they can contribute to it whilst also fulfilling their own personal calling.


  Some founders and CEOs—such as Jos de Blok at [Buurtzorg](http://www.buurtzorgusa.org/) and Yvon Chouinard at [Patagonia](http://eu.patagonia.com/enGB/home)—find this module so significant that they choose to participate in every onboarding session.


  #### **Meeting practices**


  Meetings, more often than not, turn into playing fields for the egos, pushing souls into hiding. For that reason, almost all researched [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) have instituted specific meeting practices to help participants keep their egos in check and interact with each other from a place of wholeness. For new hires, it is important to know about practices such as moments of silence, and structured decisions making. This enables them to contribute to productive meetings.


  #### **Rotational programs**


  Some organizations choose to train every new colleague in frontline skills. The goal is to build relationships with other employees across the company and to build understanding of how the company operates. This understanding enables people to develop new ideas and suggestions more effectively.


  At [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), the French automotive supplier, all engineers and administrative workers have been trained to operate at least one machine on the shop floor. This builds community and allows everyone to help on the shop floor when demand is high.


  At [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/), all new hires start with a “manufacturing tour”, no matter what their future role will be. This approach builds understanding and a sense of community across the organization. It is not uncommon for people to take on a different role to the one they were hired for after this process.
faq:
  - question: How to reduce the risk of new colleagues leaving the organization
      during onboarding because of a Teal practices mismatch?
    answer: >-
      Have in depth interviews with candidates performed by future colleagues
      and focus on fit with organizational purpose and practices of
      [self-management](../self-management/), [wholeness](../wholeness/) and
      [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). Pay particular attention
      to candidates that formerly held senior positions in other organizations.
      Turnover rates are high within this group, which is illustrated by the
      following example:


      Paul Green Jr., who heads [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/)’s Self-Management Institute, estimates that close to 50 percent of people who formerly had senior positions in other organizations (VP levels or above) end up leaving the organization after a year or two “because they have a hard time adapting to a system where they can’t play God".
  - question: How to maintain Teal practices when many new colleagues from non teal
      organizations are joining?
    answer: The onboarding of large groups of new colleagues from non [Teal
      organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) can result in
      tensions. Best way to avoid disruptive tensions is to have a steady intake
      of new colleagues and avoiding very large groups of new people starting at
      once.
  - question: How to onboard new colleagues by formal training and at the same time
      give them time and space to be able to find their way by intuitive
      exploration?
    answer: "Make sure you select a mix of practices that not only appeal to the
      rational, but also touch the heart and the soul of new colleagues.
      Further, you may consider inviting them to co create their onboarding
      program. "
