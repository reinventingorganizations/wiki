  ## 新视角


  人类组织每一个历史阶段，都产生了对入职的不同观点以及截然不同的实践：


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，领导人不断行使权力以维持控制。酋长经常让家人和亲信顾问簇拥在左右，通过分享战利品来换取他们的忠诚。入职过程通常包括对领导者宣誓忠诚的仪式。传达关于领导者权力的一系列神话故事，也是入职过程的一部分。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)重视秩序和可预测性。在这个有明确岗位和责任定义的等级体系中，每个人都有固定的位置。入职过程聚焦于学习目标岗位的要求和期望。这通常意味着教育新人忽略个人的需要和感受，只求对公司有利。认为人们应该遵守规则，呆在自己的“盒子”里。


  #### **橙色组织**


  [橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) 动力是竞争和成就感。创新是保持领先的关键。入职流程通常注重功能。虽然也可能会收到一些关于公司历史、使命宣言和价值观的宣传册，也可能会有一个两小时的会议，由一位高级领导谈论这些话题。但大多数情况下，第一步通常很俗：签署一些合同，找一张桌子和电脑，分配新人进入公司网络的密码。一旦准备好后，新成员就必须努力去在顶头上司的日程上获得时间安排，以便得到关于具体任务内容的指导。


  #### **绿色组织**


  [绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)注重文化和授权，努力鼓励成员的积极性。管理者入职培训的一个重要方面是培训公仆式领导方法和技能。由管理者在欢迎新成员加入公司流程中，扮演着重要角色，帮助新人了解企业文化。入职培训通常是关于社区建设，并以开放的方式介绍认识新家庭。


  #### **蔚蓝组织**


  [ ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)蔚蓝组织投入大量时间和精力迎接和培训新同事。通常包括让新人学习新的同事关系技巧，理解自我管理在实践中的意义，并且实施轮训计划。这些活动培训组织内通用的技能，并为新同事提供一个结识各类同事的机会。此外，还会向新人介绍[自我管理](../self-management/), [完整人性](../wholeness/)和[进化目标](../evolutionary-purpose/)的实践流程，邀请他们沉思，如何将自己的使命感以及兴趣和专长，融入组织的目标和活动。

  ## **实践中**


  #### 关系技能与公司文化培训


  [蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)投入大量的时间和能量欢迎新同事。入职的最初几天和几周至关重要，这期间帮助新人理解这个与往常非常不同的崭新类型的工作场所。入职过程的核心是通过某种形式的培训，帮助新同事了解并适应所加入的新环境。


  例如，在布尔佐格，所有团队的新成员都接受过解决问题和会议流程方面的培训，所以都获得了在没有老板负责的情况下，在团队中自主运作的能力。[海利根菲尔德](http://www.heiligenfeld.com/)的所有新成员都要经历六个培训模块，其中包括“自我控制”和“应对失败”等主题。[晨星](http://www.morningstarco.com/)的所有新人都参加一个关于[自我管理](../self-management/)的基础知识研讨会。


  For people who were previously in leadership positions, the transition can be particularly difficult. They have to learn how to get things done without recourse to command and control.


  A significant part of the onboarding process is often dedicated to understanding the concept of [Evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). New employees are encouraged to express their personal calling to see how it resonates with the organization' s purpose and to learn how they might support and nurture each other.


  There is no perfect recipe for a Teal onboarding process. Each organization chooses a range of activities that aim to teach new skills and, in the process, touch the heart and soul of those joining. A good way to develop an onboarding process is to ask employees, especially new ones, to co-create their own onboarding program and activities.


  Foundational training in some of the following practices helps new colleagues starting in a Teal organization.


  #### **Ground rules or agreements**


  Creating a safe workplace starts with raising everybody’s awareness of the words and actions that create or undermine a safe working environment. Teal organizations spend significant time and energy training everybody in a number of ground rules or agreements that support healthy and productive collaboration. These ground rules are a tangible application of the [culture and values](../culture-and-values/) of the organization. Several of the organizations end up writing down these in a document.


  Of course, it takes more than a document to bring values to life. Many researched Teal organizations have chosen to start right at the beginning: all new recruits are invited, as part of the onboarding, to a training session about the company values and ground rules, which helps to create common references and a common language across the organization. Those ground rules and values are regularly revisited to ensure they best reflect and serve the Evolutionary purpose of the organization.


  #### **Purpose**


  A dialogue on how the organization's purpose resonates with new colleagues personal calling can be a great mutual introduction. [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) are seen as having a life and a sense of direction of their own. Instead of trying to predict and control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen in and understand what the organization wants to become. By understanding the Evolutionary purpose, they can see how they can contribute to it whilst also fulfilling their own personal calling.


  Some founders and CEOs—such as Jos de Blok at [Buurtzorg](http://www.buurtzorgusa.org/) and Yvon Chouinard at [Patagonia](http://eu.patagonia.com/enGB/home)—find this module so significant that they choose to participate in every onboarding session.


  #### **Meeting practices**


  Meetings, more often than not, turn into playing fields for the egos, pushing souls into hiding. For that reason, almost all researched [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) have instituted specific meeting practices to help participants keep their egos in check and interact with each other from a place of wholeness. For new hires, it is important to know about practices such as moments of silence, and structured decisions making. This enables them to contribute to productive meetings.


  #### **Rotational programs**


  Some organizations choose to train every new colleague in frontline skills. The goal is to build relationships with other employees across the company and to build understanding of how the company operates. This understanding enables people to develop new ideas and suggestions more effectively.


  At [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/), the French automotive supplier, all engineers and administrative workers have been trained to operate at least one machine on the shop floor. This builds community and allows everyone to help on the shop floor when demand is high.


  At [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/), all new hires start with a “manufacturing tour”, no matter what their future role will be. This approach builds understanding and a sense of community across the organization. It is not uncommon for people to take on a different role to the one they were hired for after this process.
faq:
  - question: How to reduce the risk of new colleagues leaving the organization
      during onboarding because of a Teal practices mismatch?
    answer: >-
      Have in depth interviews with candidates performed by future colleagues
      and focus on fit with organizational purpose and practices of
      [self-management](../self-management/), [wholeness](../wholeness/) and
      [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). Pay particular attention
      to candidates that formerly held senior positions in other organizations.
      Turnover rates are high within this group, which is illustrated by the
      following example:


      Paul Green Jr., who heads [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/)’s Self-Management Institute, estimates that close to 50 percent of people who formerly had senior positions in other organizations (VP levels or above) end up leaving the organization after a year or two “because they have a hard time adapting to a system where they can’t play God".
  - question: How to maintain Teal practices when many new colleagues from non teal
      organizations are joining?
    answer: The onboarding of large groups of new colleagues from non [Teal
      organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) can result in
      tensions. Best way to avoid disruptive tensions is to have a steady intake
      of new colleagues and avoiding very large groups of new people starting at
      once.
  - question: How to onboard new colleagues by formal training and at the same time
      give them time and space to be able to find their way by intuitive
      exploration?
    answer: "Make sure you select a mix of practices that not only appeal to the
      rational, but also touch the heart and the soul of new colleagues.
      Further, you may consider inviting them to co create their onboarding
      program. "
