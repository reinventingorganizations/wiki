  危机管理的主题涉及到，蔚蓝组织在发生危机或进行特别具有挑战性决策时，如何迅速而有效进行组织活动，及其与常规[决策](../decision-making/)过程的不同。

  在蔚蓝组织中，每个人都参与决策、能依靠集体智慧产生最佳反应。


  人类组织在每个历史阶段都产生了对危机管理的不同看法，以及截然不同的做法：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，组织的特点是只有短期规划视角，但可以敏捷反应，这有助于处理危机。领导可以在突发奇想的情况下做出决策，并通过红色模式的标签突破--指挥权将决策下发传递给员工。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀模式](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，组织变得更加稳定和可预测。开始通过流程和程序定义完成任务的方式。认为工人需要指导。在不可预测的危机领域，首席执行官和最高管理层会做出决策，然后将这些决策转化为对下一层的命令。期待部下毫无疑问的执行决策内容。


  #### 橙色组织


  在[橙色模式](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，决策基于有效性，衡量标准是对利润和市场份额等指标的影响。橙色的决策权更多基于专业知识而不是等级制度中的地位。在危机中，可能会由精选顾问组成的专责小组秘密开会，为首席执行官和董事会提供建议。遇到危机时，高层管理人员会面临重获控制权的压力，危机处理决策权可能自然集中在高级管理人员手中。通常在决策之后进行决策内容沟通，并期望决策被部下迅速实施。


  #### 绿色组织


  在价值观驱动、目标导向的[绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，通过权力下放和授权将日常决策下放到一线员工身上，他们可以在没有管理层批准的情况下做出决策。对于影响深远的决策，高级管理层在采取行动之前会重视并寻求共识。但危机决策对这些做法是个挑战。对于高度争议和时间敏感的决策，首席执行官可能会介入，暂停通常的共识模式，做出自上而下的决定。


  #### 蔚蓝组织


  在蔚蓝范式中，每个人都参与决策，以便从集体智慧中产生最佳反应。即使特殊情况需要暂停咨询流程，暂停的范围和时间也会是有限的。

  #### 坚守建议流程


  蔚蓝组织所采用的常规[决策](../decision-making/)模式是建议流程，这个流程支撑分布式决策权。这也是蔚蓝组织处理危机局势的首选方法。


  ##### *Trusting the process*


  Crisis Management via the advice process is an ultimate demonstration of \[Self-Management Self Management]. In crises, sensitive and urgent decisions may have negative implications for employees and the organization as a whole: for example, loss of jobs, or selling off parts of the business.


  It is natural, given the earlier organization models, to question the capacity of staff to be included in making decisions in such sensitive circumstances.


  A leader of a Teal organization is challenged to trust in the advice process anyway. They risk the unknown reaction of the employees, and the potential for things to descend into chaos or adversarial exchanges. However, when the advice process is not used, there is a risk of losing the trust of the employees by doubting their ability to resolve the situation. When employees are fully engaged with the advice process in a crisis, they are asked to share responsibility for difficult decisions and trusted to make a contribution. This is empowering and helps the organization to grow.


  See [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) and [Buurtzorg](http://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/) below.


  #### Suspending the advice process


  Occasionally a crisis may require the advice process to be suspended because of the scale or urgency of the situation. Under these circumstances the leader may choose to suspend the advice process temporarily. This can be acceptable providing:


  * the reasons for the suspension are fully disclosed

  * the limitations (time period, areas of decision making etc) are explained

  * Decision making is passed to a capable person rather than the leader


  See [AES](http://www.aes.com/) below.


  #### Self-management


  Dealing with a crisis via the advice process is a key test of self management. Leaders are asked to suspend any desire to take charge and trust the workforce to deliver effective solutions. There is an underlying belief that employees are responsible, committed and capable.


  #### Wholeness


  By upholding the advice process, even in crisis situations, leader(s) are forced to face a fear that losing control could imperil the organization, cause chaos, and risk the interests of stakeholders. Crisis situations provide an opportunity for leaders to demonstrate their wholeness by being transparent, potentially vulnerable and genuinely supportive of their colleagues' participation. Employees in turn are invited to take responsibility for their own feelings in situations that may have unwelcome outcomes.


  A crisis situation offers an opportunity for an organization to come together as a whole to find solutions. This often leads to more powerful solutions than those created by a leader or a group of advisors in isolation. When these situations are successfully addressed, the organization collectively experiences a growth into \[Wholeness wholeness].


  #### Evolutionary purpose


  When employees are engaged in the advice process in a crisis, they are invited to understand what is unfolding and participate actively in the decisions that need to be taken. Deciding what to do asks everyone to re-connect with the purpose of the organization. Serving the needs of the evolutionary purpose becomes an important factor in deciding what to do. Without this reference point, decision making can easily be dominated by self interest and survival needs.

  - question: No matter what is theoretically attractive, there must be occasions
      when 'the buck stops here'?
    answer: "'The buck stops here' is part of our inheritance of 'heroic
      management'. Theoretically, it sounds unarguable. Perhaps the best answers
      are what can happen in practice. Three examples of crisis management below
      (Favi, Buurtzorg, AES) show how three Teal organizations have handled
      crises constructively. "
