  本主题“创新与产品开发”描述了蔚蓝组织如何取得进步和改进。

  橙色的缺点之一是“创新狂热”。随着我们大多数基本需求得到满足，企业越发试图创造需求，给人一种错觉，认为多多益善（贪婪）：企业出于利益追求而洗脑消费者，告诉人们说得到更多其实并不必须的东西，就会让我们快乐和完整，比如—更多的财产、最新的时尚、更年轻的身体。我们逐渐开始认识到，从金融和生态的角度来看，这种建立在虚假需求基础上的经济，大部分是不可持续的，也无法带给人持续的快乐。我们已经到了一个，常常为了增长而追求增长的阶段，这种情况在医学术语中被简单地称为癌症。^\[Laloux,

  对于[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)来说，创新的动力来自于组织的[进化目标](../evolutionary-purpose/)。创新的概念超越了利益追求而上升到组织成长层面，也不再通过传统的利润和竞争透镜来追求创新。为了评估一项创新是否值得，蔚蓝组织会使用大量能支撑美、创造力和最终服务于组织目与社会等标尺为导向的决策证据。


  关于早期组织的创新和产品开发的更多信息：


  #### **红色组织**


  [红色组织](../red-organizations/)的特征是机会主义和适应性。目标是适应环境，不是专门为创新而组织运作。


  #### 琥珀组织


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)重视可预测的流程。通过依存并维持一些被证实有效的工具与职能来维持持续存在性。创新在自上而下的批准认可后才谨慎采用。


  #### Orange organizations


  With [Orange](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), innovation becomes a core practice. It is necessary to stay competitive. At the organization level, there is investment in R&D. Research centers might be established. At the operating level, units are encouraged to be creative in how they achieve their targets. All these activities are subject to review in the regular operating and strategic planning cycles.


  #### Green organizations


  [Green organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) are values-based. This colors their approach to innovation. It’s not only about making money, but about also serving their greater purpose. This is reflected in product development/selection at, say, a place like Whole Foods. And it encourages service level initiative—as at Southwestern Airlines. Their multi-stakeholder view encourages them to find novel approaches to labor relations, employee empowerment, customer service, shareholder interests, and the communities of which they are a part.

  In Teal, the focus is to find better ways to serve the organization's unique
  sense of evolutionary purpose, rather than out-think the competition. Members
  are encouraged to “listen” for opportunities, and test these via the advice
  process. This means ideas must be discussed with knowledgeable colleagues. In
  this environment, anyone, and everyone, can be an innovator.


  #### Design for Life, Beauty, Benefit


  Product innovation in traditional companies is commonly the result of exhaustive analyses of customer segments, buyer behavior and the competition—a very ‘left-brain’ approach.


  In Teal, the source of innovation is more ‘right brain’. It is spurred by purpose, and arises from ‘listening’ for what seem to be the right offerings. It attempts to answer these questions:


  *\- “What product would we be really proud of?”*


  *\- “What product would fill a genuine need in the world?”'*


  *\- “What product or service are we uniquely capable of providing?”'*


  These reflections are guided by intuition and perceptions of beauty. They can also be supported by structured design practices that are intended to catalyze empathetic thinking. An example is the concept of "design ideation"^\[Ideation for product design from IDEO - <http://www.ideo.com/>]This is a process where frontline workers spend long periods out in the field, observing how their customers are using their products and services.


  #### Innovation at the frontlines


  Any frontline person can act on insights gained from working closely with the customer and therefore having a deep understanding of his or her needs. With Teal self-management, there is nothing to hold back a good idea from being pursued if it has use for customers and if its pursuit adheres to the advice process.


  #### Practice sharing


  New insights and practices are systematically shared through Teal Organizations, often through an intranet or wiki. Through sense and respond and various practices supporting evolutionary purpose, these successful innovations can potentially be adopted quickly throughout the organization.


  #### Innovation impacts whole organization


  Emergent innovation does not just follow organizational purpose but may impact the evolutionary purpose of a Teal organization, shifting its impulse into a new direction and potential.
faq:
  - question: How would a strong visionary and innovative personality fit into a
      Teal organization, such as for example Steve Jobs?
    answer: In Teal organizations decision-making is bounded by the advice process.
      Anybody with strong skills in a particular area can contribute,
      irrespective of position, and this is certainly true with respect to
      innovation. However, the Teal paradigm also confers on all decision-makers
      the obligation to respect the advice process and consult with appropriate
      individuals within the organization. This does not mean that everyone
      consulted has to agree with a proposed innovation, only that his or her
      advice is considered. To the extent that Steve Jobs’ success as an
      innovator was facilitated by his working in a conventional hierarchical
      structure and his consequential ability to make decisions unilaterally,
      this might lessen his effectiveness in a Teal organization. However, at
      the same time, the collective innovative intelligence of the entire
      organization is unleashed under Teal, making it not nearly so dependent on
      the contributions of a single individual.
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      All three Teal breakthroughs are supported by the practices and principles
      for Teal innovation and product development.


      #### Self-management


      [Self management](../self-management/) allows anybody to innovate and develop improvements in products and services with minimal delay. The empathetic understanding that frontline staff have for their customers can be used to act on observed needs.


      #### Wholeness


      [Wholeness](../wholeness/) is integrated into the design and product development process through a "whole brain" approach. Teal innovation designs for aspects such as beauty and through intuition as well as more traditional market or customer analysis.


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      In Teal, innovations are selected first and foremost based on fit with the organization's [purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/). Furthermore, innovation plays a key role in the evolution of that purpose.
