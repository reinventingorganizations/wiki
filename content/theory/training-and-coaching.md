  ## 新视角


  #### 新视角


  蔚蓝组织的自我管理机制，可以提供特殊的学习机会。每个人都被鼓励自主开发自己的角色，成员接受的机会越多，学到的东西就越多。与传统模式的关键区别在于人们对自己的存在和发展负责。不存在运行培训课程来填补组织中空缺角色的人力资源部门。但[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)通常提供高效而重要的[入职流程](../onboarding/)。


  人类组织在每一个历史阶段，都带来了独特的培训和辅导方法。


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，新人需要深刻了解组织的权力机制：需要理解如何获得权力以及如何使用权力。这种学习来自于观察和倾听。可能有个“入会”仪式。也可能有一些培训交易技能的工具。除此之外，大多数知识都是通过观察和倾听获得的，个人的资历就像非正式的学徒一样逐渐增长。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，有明确而具体的岗位角色划分。培训的目的是为了让组织内各级人员有效地履行其职责和责任（例如在军队中进行军官培训）。有些成员的职业培训由独立机构（职业学校或大学）提供。重视针对特定专业的资格证书。还会通过在职期间的持续培训，让每个级别的优秀人才都能得到晋升机会。


  #### **Orange organizations**


  [Orange organizations](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) have adopted the revolutionary premise of meritocracy. In principle, anybody can move up the ladder. The mail room boy can become the CEO - even if that boy happens to be a girl or have a minority back-ground. This progress is supported by a Training Department, often a sub-section of HR. It is not unusual to have lists of competencies required for each role in the organization (sales people, technicians, new managers, emerging managers, senior managers, and so on). The pervasive thinking is that talent should be developed to fill the present and future boxes on the organization chart. This breakthrough in social fairness gives people options, at least in principle, to pursue the path that best suits their talents.


  Coaching is often available to senior managers and leaders to help them settle into new roles and perform better. Coaching is usually not available to those lower down in the organization.


  #### **Green organizations**


  [Green organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/) build on the practices of Orange organizations by adding a twist to management development. Managers are expected to be in service to those they lead, support and serve. Candidates for management positions are often screened for mindset and behavior to assess:


  * whether they are ready to share power?

  * If they will they lead with humility?

  * how well they will model the culture and values of the organization?


  Training and coaching will often be offered to those who are successful to help them put their leadership into practice more effectively.


  This elevates the importance of human resources within the organization. A large staff might necessitate processes like culture initiatives, 360-degree feedback, succession planning and morale surveys.


  #### **Teal organizations**


  [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) do not have an HR function. However, because they are self-managed, they can provide exceptional learning opportunities. Everyone is encouraged to develop their roles and try out new things. The more they embrace opportunities, the more they learn--either from their colleagues or from the training taken to develop new skills. The key difference is that people take responsibility for their own development. There is no HR department running training courses to fill roles in the organization. Teal organizations still invest in skills training. But this is often delivered by colleagues. It is common for Teal organizations to offer significant on-boarding training. It is difficult to transfer from a traditional organization without learning the new rules, and unlearning the old ones.

  #### **Training**


  In a Teal organization there is no need for career development programs. Instead training tends to focus on personal growth and building a common culture. Skill training programs are still needed and are open to all those who require them. They are often led by colleagues rather than external trainers because the training then becomes deeply infused with the company’s [values and culture](../culture-and-values/).


  ##### ***Personal responsibility and freedom for training***


  The biggest change is that employees are in charge of their own learning. They choose training to serve their own growth rather than training for career development. Provided members use the advice process, they can usually arrange any training they need. Some organizations have simplified matters by allowing colleagues to spend up to a specific amount on training without using the advice process. 


  ##### ***Different categories of training***


  In self-managing organizations there are no training programs for climbing the ladder. But they offer training rarely found in traditional organizations: training in the common culture and its processes (attended by all), and personal development training. Skill training programs still exist as required.  These are often led by colleagues rather than external trainers, people who really understand the company’s values and culture.


  ##### ***Onboarding***


  When someone joins a Teal organization it can take a while to understand the culture and processes that support it. As a consequence, Teal organzations tend to invest heavily in induction training. New hires are introduced to the various processes and given time to meet and work with a range of people across the organization. They may also be given training in subjects such as active listening, conflict resolution and problem solving.


  ##### ***Ongoing training for all***


  Training tends to be a continuous process for all in the organization. This typically happens through the advice process and through dedicating time to support the organizational culture.


  The advice process enables people to talk to and seek the advice of a range of people they would probably not have to deal with in a more conventional organization. As a consequence much is learnt about wide range of issues. The variety of roles that people take on also encourages this process.


  Teal organizations also end to run regular sessions to help build and develop the culture. These can include sessions where people can work on their own development with group support through to workshops designed to tune into the purpose of the organization. At [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) Jean-François Zobrist hosted a session every Friday morning to address a specific cultural issue; these were open to anyone.


  ##### ***Employees become trainers***


  It is common practice to stop (or reduce) the use of external trainers. Classes are presented by colleagues who are passionate about the subject, and who tailor material to the language and culture of the organization. It is not uncommon for courses to go from the inside out. They might start by helping people to connect with who they are, and invite them to find authentic ways to express this as they discuss the subject matter. It could be difficult for an outsider to lead this discussion. Using members as trainers saves money and boosts morale--because it offers the trainer an opportunity to give and be recognized for their expertise.


  #### **Coaching**


  Coaching practices tend to be embedded in the organization and available to all. Coaching can take a number of different formats:


  ##### ***Team supervision***


  Working in teams invariably brings up tensions that can either be ignored or worked through. Dealing with the personal and underlying issues effectively is invariable a source of significant growth. It is not surprising that coaching support is available to facilitate this growth.


  [Heiligenfeld](http://www.heiligenfeld.com/) has a simple practice of coaching in team supervision. The company works with four external coaches who each have their domain of expertise (relationships, organization development, systems thinking and leadership). There are time slots with these coaches every month that teams can sign-up for. It's recommended that each team has at least one session a year; the average is two to four. With the help of the outsider, colleagues explore what a tension reveals about themselves and how they can resolve it.


  ##### ***Peer coaching***


  Peer coaching is a way of using the power of the team to help on an individual basis. Buutzorg for example, has a peer coaching process called ‘Intervesie”. It is structured process for helping an individual address and resolve an issue or problem with team support. Rather than falling into the common practices of offering advice or reassurance, the process allows the individual to work out a way forward on their own. There is often significant growth in the process as personal issues are recognized and worked through in a safe space.


  ##### ***Individual coaching***


  Some organizations offer individual coaching or counselling to all their members on a free and confidential basis, to both employees and their families for non-work matters. This reinforces the principle of wholeness by supporting the member in all aspects of their life.


  Some companies offer individual coaching to all their members. Others extend this, on a free and confidential basis, to employees and their families for non-work matters.

  - question: How can a member make sensible choices about her own training when she
      doesn't know what she doesn't know?
    answer: Even if we assume she doesn't know, she will almost certainly seek
      advice from someone with more experience. This will help her confirm or
      amend her choice. And by going through the self-development process, she
      will learn more about what she needs, and the learning approaches that
      suit her. In other words, she gets better at getting better! In a
      traditional environment, HR tells her what she should learn, and how she
      should learn it. If these choices are wise, fine. If not, money and time
      are wasted.
