intro: 培训和辅导事关组织特有的知识与技能开发，以及如何帮助成员理解公司特有的文化。目的是促进成员为组织提供全然而健康的贡献。

  ## 新视角


  人类组织在每一个历史阶段，都带来了独特的培训和辅导方法。


  #### **红色组织**


  在[红色组织](../red-organizations/)中，新人需要深刻了解组织的权力机制：需要理解如何获得权力以及如何使用权力。这种学习来自于观察和倾听。可能有个“入会”仪式。也可能有一些培训交易技能的工具。除此之外，大多数知识都是通过观察和倾听获得的，个人的资历就像非正式的学徒一样逐渐增长。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，有明确而具体的岗位角色划分。培训的目的是为了让组织内各级人员有效地履行其职责和责任（例如在军队中进行军官培训）。有些成员的职业培训由独立机构（职业学校或大学）提供。重视针对特定专业的资格证书。还会通过在职期间的持续培训，让每个级别的优秀人才都能得到晋升机会。


  #### **橙色组织**


  [橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)引入了精英制这个变革性要件。原则上任何人都有机会升职。邮件收发室的男孩可以成为首席执行官——即使那个男孩碰巧是个女孩或者是少数民族裔。培训部门（通常是人力资源部的一个分支）为这一进展提供支持。通常组织会制作每个岗位角色（销售人员、技术人员、新人经理、中层经理、资深经理、高级经理等）所需的能力要求列表。橙色中一个常见的想法是，认为应该培养人才来填补组织结构图中现在和未来的空缺。这是个带来社会公平的突破，至少在原则上给人们更多机会，去选择追求最适合自己才能的道路。


  新入职的高级管理人员和领导者通常可以获得被辅导的机会，目的是帮助他们适应新的角色，并取得更好的绩效。组织中下级层面的成员通常得不到这类辅导。


  #### **绿色组织**


  [绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)以橙色组织的做法为基础，但增加了一个先进的管理理念。开始认为管理者应该为自己的部下提供支持与服务（公仆领导）。通常会根据应聘者的思维和行为来筛选管理职位，评估角度包括：


  * 他们是否准备好让部下分享权力？

  * 他们是否会谦卑地领导他人？

  * 他们是否能成为组织文化和价值观模板？


  培训和辅导通常会提供给那些已经很成功的人，以帮助他们更有效地将领导能力付诸实践。


  这些举措提高了人力资源在组织内的重要性。往往会需要一个庞大的管理团队和一些流程来支撑，如文化倡议、360度反馈、继任计划和士气调查。


  #### **蔚蓝组织**


  [蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)没有人力资源职能。自我管理机制能为成员提供额外的学习机会。鼓励每个人自觉开发定义自己的角色并尝试新事物。成员越是拥抱机会，越能习得更多的知识和技能--要么从同事那里学到，要么从新技能培训中学到。与传统模式的关键区别在于，成员能对自己的发展和成长自我负责。这类组织不会预定义各种角色，也不需要设置人力资源部，来提供针对固定岗位角色所需的知识和技能的各类培训课程，更不会为填补组织中的角色空缺而开设培训课程。不过通常蔚蓝组织仍然在技能培训方面进行投资。但通常由同事来完成。蔚蓝组织都会提供有效的[入职流程](../onboarding/)，主要是关于通用的公司文化和重要流程。从传统组织转入的人员，如果不学会各种新规则，同时忘记那些旧的规则和习惯，会困难重重。

  #### **Training**


  In a Teal organization there is no need for career development programs. Instead training tends to focus on personal growth and building a common culture. Skill training programs are still needed and are open to all those who require them. They are often led by colleagues rather than external trainers because the training then becomes deeply infused with the company’s [values and culture](../culture-and-values/).


  ##### ***Personal responsibility and freedom for training***


  The biggest change is that employees are in charge of their own learning. They choose training to serve their own growth rather than training for career development. Provided members use the advice process, they can usually arrange any training they need. Some organizations have simplified matters by allowing colleagues to spend up to a specific amount on training without using the advice process. 


  ##### ***Different categories of training***


  In self-managing organizations there are no training programs for climbing the ladder. But they offer training rarely found in traditional organizations: training in the common culture and its processes (attended by all), and personal development training. Skill training programs still exist as required.  These are often led by colleagues rather than external trainers, people who really understand the company’s values and culture.


  ##### ***Onboarding***


  When someone joins a Teal organization it can take a while to understand the culture and processes that support it. As a consequence, Teal organzations tend to invest heavily in induction training. New hires are introduced to the various processes and given time to meet and work with a range of people across the organization. They may also be given training in subjects such as active listening, conflict resolution and problem solving.


  ##### ***Ongoing training for all***


  Training tends to be a continuous process for all in the organization. This typically happens through the advice process and through dedicating time to support the organizational culture.


  The advice process enables people to talk to and seek the advice of a range of people they would probably not have to deal with in a more conventional organization. As a consequence much is learnt about wide range of issues. The variety of roles that people take on also encourages this process.


  Teal organizations also end to run regular sessions to help build and develop the culture. These can include sessions where people can work on their own development with group support through to workshops designed to tune into the purpose of the organization. At [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) Jean-François Zobrist hosted a session every Friday morning to address a specific cultural issue; these were open to anyone.


  ##### ***Employees become trainers***


  It is common practice to stop (or reduce) the use of external trainers. Classes are presented by colleagues who are passionate about the subject, and who tailor material to the language and culture of the organization. It is not uncommon for courses to go from the inside out. They might start by helping people to connect with who they are, and invite them to find authentic ways to express this as they discuss the subject matter. It could be difficult for an outsider to lead this discussion. Using members as trainers saves money and boosts morale--because it offers the trainer an opportunity to give and be recognized for their expertise.


  #### **Coaching**


  Coaching practices tend to be embedded in the organization and available to all. Coaching can take a number of different formats:


  ##### ***Team supervision***


  Working in teams invariably brings up tensions that can either be ignored or worked through. Dealing with the personal and underlying issues effectively is invariable a source of significant growth. It is not surprising that coaching support is available to facilitate this growth.


  [Heiligenfeld](http://www.heiligenfeld.com/) has a simple practice of coaching in team supervision. The company works with four external coaches who each have their domain of expertise (relationships, organization development, systems thinking and leadership). There are time slots with these coaches every month that teams can sign-up for. It's recommended that each team has at least one session a year; the average is two to four. With the help of the outsider, colleagues explore what a tension reveals about themselves and how they can resolve it.


  ##### ***Peer coaching***


  Peer coaching is a way of using the power of the team to help on an individual basis. Buutzorg for example, has a peer coaching process called ‘Intervesie”. It is structured process for helping an individual address and resolve an issue or problem with team support. Rather than falling into the common practices of offering advice or reassurance, the process allows the individual to work out a way forward on their own. There is often significant growth in the process as personal issues are recognized and worked through in a safe space.


  ##### ***Individual coaching***


  Some organizations offer individual coaching or counselling to all their members on a free and confidential basis, to both employees and their families for non-work matters. This reinforces the principle of wholeness by supporting the member in all aspects of their life.


  Some companies offer individual coaching to all their members. Others extend this, on a free and confidential basis, to employees and their families for non-work matters.
faq:
  - question: How can a member make sensible choices about her own training when she
      doesn't know what she doesn't know?
    answer: Even if we assume she doesn't know, she will almost certainly seek
      advice from someone with more experience. This will help her confirm or
      amend her choice. And by going through the self-development process, she
      will learn more about what she needs, and the learning approaches that
      suit her. In other words, she gets better at getting better! In a
      traditional environment, HR tells her what she should learn, and how she
      should learn it. If these choices are wise, fine. If not, money and time
      are wasted.
