  #### 工作时间


  在传统的金字塔等级制度中，工作时间一般规定在雇佣合同中。管理者常常有一种潜在的恐惧，认为成员在没有监督的情况下，将无法按规定的时间工作，尤其是组织中较低级别的成员。


  如果给与成员选择和商定自己工作时间的自由，就能带来一种信任的环境，激励人们对自己的工作负全责。


  如果一个组织还没有做好自我管理的准备，但可以率先尝试工作时间的自主设计，这会是个很好的转型起点。当这种方法运行良好时，会开始在上司和下属之间建立更大的信任和协作。


  #### 任务承诺


  蔚蓝文化认为，同事们在工作中可以自由坦诚的分享自己人生中的其他责任内容（私事），这既是正常的也是必要的。在这种文化氛围工作的成员，会自然培育并接纳自己和他人的真实而完整的人性。在职场提供可以公开谈论个人的完整人生许诺内容（包括那些与工作无关的私人角度）的机会，可以在同事之间建立更亲密更牢固的关系，并形成一种同事间相互支持的文化。（无论是工作上还是私人生活中，将职场与私人生活融为一体。）


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，当出现需要或危机时，例如在旺季，成员通常会主动延长工作时间，带着动力和自豪感完成任务，支持同事，朝着组织的目标努力。

  人类组织在每一个历史阶段都产生了对承诺、工作时间和弹性化的不同看法，以及截然不同的做法：


  #### **Red organizations**


  In [Red organizations](../red-organizations/), the boss determines working hours for each person. There is no formal process of setting and/or monitoring working hours. People belong to the organization and are expected to be available when needed.


  #### **Amber organizations**


  In [Amber Organizations](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/), working hours are determined by senior leaders and specified in an employment contract. They decide what work is to be carried out and how working hours will be monitored.


  #### **Orange organizations**


  In [Orange organizations](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/), people generally fall into one of two camps. There are those (often in manual roles) who work a fixed set of hours clocking in and clocking out, and those (often in management positions), who are expected to get their work done regardless of the hours stated in their contract.


  #### **Green organizations**


  In [Green organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/), there is typically a culture of co-operation where people are empowered to work the hours they choose albeit within a defined structure. Flex-time is often used for lower-level workers in order to allow people to fit work in with the rest of their life. Working from home is a realistic option for those whose role allows it.


  #### **Teal organizations**


  On the surface, [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)may not look so different from Green ones relative to commitment, working hours and flexibility. The difference is in maturity and coherence. Whereas a Green organization might make the practices outlines above available to specific populations, a Teal organization would make these practices widely available as a normal part of the way they operate.


  Teal organizations often exhibit the following general measures:


  * Working hours are not controlled or decided by anyone

  * People are trusted to set their own goals and work until they reach them.

  * There is a shared understanding that at times, individuals may need to vary their commitment to work. These situations are shared and openly discussed so that the task in hand can be completed with everyone’s support.
inPractice: >-
  [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)start from the
  premise that even for routine work, people have a sense of pride and want to
  do a good job. People are systematically considered to be reliable,
  self-motivated, trustworthy and intelligent.


  ##### **Commitment**


  In most traditional organizations, there is an unspoken assumption that people in managerial positions should put their commitment to work above any other commitment in their lives. Few colleagues would cancel an important meeting for their child’s school play or because a good friend needs help. In self-managing organizations, speaking up about other important commitments in one's life is considered necessary to be authentic and whole at work. There is no need for the pretence that work will always come first. Teal organizations hold meetings at regular intervals in which colleagues can discuss how much time and energy, at that moment in their lives, they want to commit to the organization.  Because colleagues discuss their other commitments openly, solutions can be found to provide support and get the task done.


  ##### **Working hours/flex-time**


  In Teal organizations people are trusted to work the hours they need to achieve their own goals. There is no requirement for monitoring of working hours, or clocking in and out, or flex-time. In some Teal organizations such as [FAVI](http://www.favi.com/) and [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/), the working day is still divided into shifts, which is roughly the time colleagues are expected to spend on the shop floor, but it is not uncommon to see an operator stay on during the following shift to finish a job because he/she knows it needs to be done.


  ##### **In times of need**


  Balancing the needs of the individual with those of the organization is not always easy. For example, [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/) has a high season for tomato processing when all hands need to be on deck. If someone wants to reduce their working hours during very busy times, they are expected to find a solution to uphold the commitments they have made. This expectation is the flip side of having no HR or planning function. An individual cannot simply file a request and let someone else worry about solving this issue. He/she has full liberty to find a solution, but until they have found one, they are bound to their previous commitments.


  ##### **Working hours and Teal in the future**


  In the future, it is likely that the more people commit to ‘personal purpose’ in their lives, the more flexible their arrangements with the organization will be. Accommodating personal commitments to self-employment, part time work, or volunteering work will be normal. There will be no need for approval. A person will simply find a way to meet or transfer his/her commitments to another colleague and/or explore with colleagues what new roles and commitments he/she could take on that would add value to the organization.
faq:
  - question: What happens if a person can’t keep up their commitment to the
      organization due to other personal commitments?
    answer: The regular meeting held to share personal commitments provides the
      forum for this to be aired with colleagues. If someone wants to reduce
      their working hours they are expected to find a solution to uphold the
      commitments they have made. He/she has full liberty to find a solution,
      but until they have found one, they are bound to their previous
      commitments. If a colleague continually needs to work fewer hours over a
      longer period of time, then this may well be raised by that person or
      other colleagues as part of a regular peer-based compensation and self-set
      salary process.
