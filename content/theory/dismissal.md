  即使是在蔚蓝组织中，也不是所有人都能顺利融入其中或表现出色。但当这种情况发生时，蔚蓝的反应与早期组织不同。

  ## 新视角


  在蔚蓝组织中，解雇的概率很小。角色的演变往往与个人的优点匹配，人们通常具备高度的自觉自主意识和不让同事失望的愿望。裁员并不常见，因为蔚蓝组织倾向于更灵活、更迅速地适应组织的经济衰退。离开的方式更多是自愿离职。当有人不适应这种新的工作方式，绝大多数都会自愿返回其他环境。


  但作为最后手段（而且只有在解决冲突的标准流程没有成功的情况下），解雇也可能发生。解雇发生时，个人的相关情绪都会得到拥抱和处理（避免情感伤痕）。会尊重个人和自由选择。重视提供精神支持。对双方来说，离开也是一个学习和人性成长的机会。


  作为对比，这里概括早期组织对解雇的观点和处理方式：


  #### 红色组织


  在[红色模式](../red-organizations/)中，由老板/领导者决定解雇谁或留谁。不需要正式的程序。自愿离职可能被视为背叛。


  #### 琥珀组织


  在[琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，解雇往往由于失职或违反规则。后果可能是明确的。例如，初犯（迟到等）可能意味着停职一天。再犯可能会被开除。


  在现代的琥珀模式中——一些政府机构、宗教组织、公立学校、军队等——常态是长期持续（甚至终身）的就业。这些长期的关系可能会延伸到社交圈。被解雇的可能性不仅会带来失业的威胁，而且还会有可能威胁到这个人在社会上的相关位置，失去面子或容身之地。那些在琥珀色组织中得不到满足感的人，面临着非常痛苦的选择。


  #### 橙色组织


  [橙色组织 ](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)对解雇积累了广泛成熟的实践。权力通常由老板掌握（虽然有些可能要由人事部批准或寻求其建议）。


  解雇原因通常是绩效或组织成本削减/战略调整的结果。基本上不存在关于保障成员持续稳定就业的隐性规则或合同规定。


  组织通常有完善的绩效管理体系。于是，当成员的绩效低于组织标准，努力之后仍无提高时，就会被解雇。


  解雇也可能被视为招聘流程的一个失败。这是因为，雇佣一个后来证明不符合要求的人，被视为成本浪费。解雇赔偿也不少见。有时还要帮助被解雇者找到新工作。橙色组织的解雇处理有时可能相当进步。


  #### 绿色组织


  [绿色组织 ](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)have a high tolerance for individual differences and are likelier to look for an alternative to letting people go. People who do not conform to the community rules and values may feel marginalized, and leave as a result. Otherwise, dismissal practices are similar to the Orange paradigm.

  #### People choose to leave before dismissal


  In Teal organizations, dismissals prove to be surprisingly rare—because of the in-built flexibility. Self-management means people can customize a job at which they excel. A person with “performance issues” might shed one or more roles in which she is not strong and take up others that better match her skills, interests, and talents. In traditional workplaces, where a job is well defined, there is usually less flexibility.


  Moreover, feedback on performance in Teal does not come from another, remote level (like a boss or HR). It comes from colleagues. There is much less reason to find fault with their feelings about your performance. These are the people you need to work with everyday. If this feels awkward, you can take an adult decision to move on.


  For example, at Sun Hydraulics, an engineer might notice that somehow little work comes his way — few colleagues invite him to join their projects, or solicit his advice. At Buurtzorg, a nurse will feel in her interactions with colleagues that she doesn’t fit the team, or that self-management doesn’t suit her after all. About 25 nurses elect to leave each month for that reason (while 250 nurses join every month).


  Almost universally, people choose to leave before they are dismissed. And almost always the departure happens by mutual consent, and on a friendly basis. This does not change the fact that on a personal level the process can be painful. The self-managing context helps people realize that no one is to blame; that they are perhaps not meant for this kind of work.


  #### Dismissal still happens occasionally


  But occasionally, self-managing organizations do face situations where they need to part ways with people who don’t fit. Perhaps someone breaches company values, or systematically fails to follow the advice process (in many Teal organizations, failing to follow the advice process is the only “fireable” offense). In both of these cases, the fundamental fabric of self-management may be threatened. These situations don’t rely on a hierarchy for action, but on peer-based mechanisms.


  It usually starts with a conflict resolution effort, initiated by a team or an individual. They talk with the person in question and try to find a mutually agreeable solution. If this fails, they can call a mediator, or a panel, to facilitate resolution. In most cases, this brings resolution. In some cases, the person and the team decide on some mutual commitments and give it another go. In others, the person comes to see that trust is irrevocably broken and understands it is time to leave.


  If no agreement can be found, and as a last chance to settle the matter, the team may ask an owner/founder to mediate. In the rare cases where even that fails, the team can ask the founder to put an end to the person’s employment. This process, with some variations, is followed at [Buurtzorg ](http://www.buurtzorgnederland.com/)and [Morning Star](http://www.morningstarco.com/).


  #### Economic troughs are handled differently


  Few Teal organizations have laid people off during downturns. Self-managing organizations are exceedingly flexible and accumulate little overhead. They weather downturns better than traditional organizations. [FAVI ](http://www.favi.com/)and [Sun Hydraulics](http://www.sunhydraulics.com/), for example, have both withstood severe recessions (with revenue decreases of 30 to 50 percent) without layoffs.


  In some cases, colleagues agree to share the pain and opt for temporary pay reductions. From a Teal perspective, it would be improper to lay off colleagues just to boost profits for a few months if the overstaffing is deemed to be only temporary.


  When an organization moves to self-management, people in management roles are no longer needed. Zappos faced that situation and offered former managers substantial time and assistance to find new roles where they could add value. They also offered all employees a generous severance payment if they did not feel fully committed to the new organization. ^\[Quartz's article "Internal Memo: Zappos is offering severance to employees who aren’t all in with Holacracy"].


  This is different to structural overstaffing. [AES ](http://www.aes.com/)faced this many times with power plants it bought in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. In some cases, the previous government owners had used the plants to create artificial jobs. After acquisition, AES swiftly reduced the number of employees, mainly via a generous voluntary severance program. Only rarely were people asked to leave. In Panama, AES created a loan fund for employees who took the package. This helped many to start new businesses.


  Maintaining jobs artificially makes no sense from a Teal perspective. A concern about job security is partly inspired by fear. It neglects the truth that everything changes. It dismisses the possibility that a person whose talents are wasted in an overstaffed organization might find a better way to express his gifts where they are needed. Life is continuously unfolding; dismissals and even layoffs can be part of that unfolding, although they are rare in self-managed structures.
faq:
  - question: How do these practices link with the three Teal breakthroughs?
    answer: >-
      In [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) the decision
      about whether a person will stay with the organization belongs with that
      individual and/or their team. Forced dismissals are infrequent because
      people are given clear indications if they are not a fit so that they can
      choose to leave voluntarily. In many cases a parting of the ways happens
      by mutual consent in the process of self-managed conflict resolution. Only
      when everything else fails do organization founders fire people, but this
      is also initiated by the team or a conflict mediation panel.


      #### Wholeness


      When you don’t have a fear that your boss may fire you at will, it’s easier to show up fully at work. If you’re not being judged and do not depend on adhering to a set of rules to stay in the job, you tend to bring your whole self to the workplace.


      [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)don’t reduce dismissals to cold, contractual transactions that avoid dealing with the emotions and pain. Instead, they accept and work with those human issues to turn departures into a learning experiences that can meaningfully enhance the person’s and the organization’s future path. 


      #### Evolutionary purpose


      Giving people the opportunity and encouraging them to actively find a new role in the company when they are not performing well or when their current role is no longer needed contributes to the organization’s ability to listen and understand what it is trying to become, to fulfill its [evolutionary purpose](../evolutionary-purpose/).
