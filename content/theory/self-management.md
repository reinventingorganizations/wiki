  Leading scientists believe that the principal science of the next century will
  be the study of complex, autocatalytic, self-organizing, non-linear, and
  adaptive systems. This is usually referred to as “complexity” or “chaos
  theory” (the Teal equivalent to Orange’s Newtonian science). But even though
  we are only now starting to get our heads around it, self-management is not a
  startling new invention by any means. It is the way life has operated in the
  world for billions of years, bringing forth creatures and ecosystems so
  magnificent and complex we can hardly comprehend them. Self-organization is
  the life force of the world, thriving on the edge of chaos with just enough
  order to funnel its energy, but not so much as to slow down adaptation and
  learning.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide

  All stages of organizations prior to Teal have relied on a hierarchical power structure, with certain people exerting authority over others. The concentration of power and decision-making at the top, separating colleagues into the powerful and the powerless, brings with it problems that have plagued organizations for as long as we can remember. Power in organizations is seen as a scarce commodity worth fighting for. This situation invariably brings out the shadowy side of human nature: personal ambition, politics, mistrust, fear, and greed. At the bottom of organizations, it often evokes the twin brothers of powerlessness: resignation and resentment. The widespread lack of motivation we witness in many organizations is a devastating side effect of the unequal distribution of power. For a few lucky people, work is a place of joyful self-expression, a place of camaraderie with colleagues in pursuit of a meaningful purpose. For far too many, it is simply drudgery, a few hours of life “rented out” every day in exchange for a paycheck. The story of the global workforce is a sad tale of wasted talent and energy.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

The overarching conclusion: just around a third of people are engaged in their work (35 percent). Many more people are “detached” or actively “disengaged” (43 percent). The remaining 22 percent feel “unsupported.”] ^[For a deep discussion of what motivates the modern worker, see Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel Pink, Riverhead Hardcover, 2009.]


  Earlier stage organizations are seemingly built on the assumption that people cannot be trusted to act in the organization’s best interest without supervision. Teal Organizations are built on a foundation of mutual trust. Workers and employees are seen as reasonable people that want to do good work and can be trusted to do the right thing. With that premise, very few rules and control mechanisms are needed. And employees are energized to make extraordinary things happen.

  Self-management in Teal comes about through a combination of innovative
  structures and processes. These are described in detail throughout the wiki,
  but a few are highlighted below:


  #### Autonomous teams


  The most common structure of Teal organizations are interdependent networks of small, autonomous teams. The nature of these networks will take a variety of forms, depending on the characteristics of their industry and environment, but all consist primarily of teams, usually 10-20 people, that self-organize and are not under the authority of anyone outside the team.


  #### No bosses or organization chart


  There are no fixed hierarchies of authority in Teal organizations. There are no bosses within or outside of the teams. The primacy of the boss-subordinate relationship is replaced with peer-based mutual commitments. Decision rights and power flow to any individual who has the expertise, interest, or willingness to step in and contribute to a situation. Fluid, natural hierarchies replace the fixed power hierarchies of the traditional pyramid - leaving the organization without an organizational chart. See also [Organizational Structure](../organizational-structure/).


  #### No job descriptions or job titles


  There are typically no job descriptions or job titles in Teal organizations. Rather each individual has a number of roles that he/she has agreed to and committed to fulfill. When someone senses an issue or an opportunity that calls for a new role, someone simply steps forward and offers to take on that role. See also [Job Titles and Job Descriptions](../job-titles-and-job-descriptions/) and [Role Definition and Allocation](../role-definition-and-allocation/).


  #### Distributed decision-making


  Decision-making is highly distributed. Decisions do not need to be validated by the hierarchy nor by consensus of the community. Any person can make any decision after seeking advice from 1) everyone who will be meaningfully affected, and 2) people with expertise in the matter. See also [Decision Making](../decision-making/).


  #### Open Information flow


  Everybody is given access to all information at the same time. See also [Information Flow](../information-flow/).


  #### Conflict resolution


  Disagreements are resolved among peers using a well defined conflict resolution process. Peers hold each other accountable for their mutual commitments. See also [Conflict Resolution](../conflict-resolution/).
faq:
  - question: Is there any evidence this actually works?
    answer: >-
      A 2009 Ernst & Young study found that Buurtzorg (see “Concrete examples
      for inspiration” below) requires, on average, close to 40 percent fewer
      hours of care per client than other nursing organizations— which is ironic
      when you consider that nurses in Buurtzorg take time for coffee and talk
      with the patients, their families, and neighbors, while other nursing
      organizations have come to time “products” in minutes. Patients stay in
      care only half as long,heal faster, and become more autonomous. A third of
      emergency hospital admissions are avoided, and when a patient does need to
      be admitted to the hospital, the average stay is shorter. The savings for
      the Dutch social security system are considerable— Ernst & Young estimates
      that close to € 2 billion would be saved in the Netherlands every year if
      all home care organizations achieved Buurtzorg’s results. Scaled to the US
      population, this savings would be equivalent to roughly $ 49
      billion^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide

      Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1521-1527). Nelson Parker. Kindle
      Edition.]


      In the case of FAVI (see “Concrete examples for inspiration” below), a foundry based in France, all its competitors have moved to China to enjoy cheaper labor costs. And yet FAVI is not only the one producer left standing in Europe; it also commands a 50 percent market share for its gearbox forks. Its product quality is legendary, and its on-time delivery close to mythical: workers are proud of their record of not a single order delivered late in over 25 years. FAVI delivers high profit margins, year in and year out, despite Chinese competition, salaries well above average, and highly cyclical demand patterns.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09).

  - question: Isn’t this the same as “empowerment”?
    answer: "Pluralistic-Green organizations seek to deal with the problem of power
      inequality through empowerment, pushing decisions down the pyramid, and
      they often achieve much higher employee engagement. But empowerment within
      the traditional hierarchy means that someone at the top must be wise or
      noble enough to give away some of his power, and those below are subject
      to that power being reclaimed.^[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing
      Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next
      Stage of Human Consciousness (Kindle Locations 1431-1433). Nelson Parker.
      Kindle Edition.]"
  - question: Does this mean that everyone is equal?
    answer: >-
      In Teal Organizations: the point is not to make everyone equal; it is to
      allow all employees to grow into the strongest, healthiest version of
      themselves. Gone is the dominator hierarchy (the structure where bosses
      hold power over their subordinates). And precisely for that reason, lots
      of natural, evolving, overlapping hierarchies can emerge— hierarchies of
      development, skill, talent, expertise, and recognition, for example. This
      is a point that management author Gary Hamel noted about Morning
      Star:^\[Laloux, Frederic (2014-02-09). Reinventing Organizations: A Guide
      to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human
      Consciousness (Kindle Locations 3050-3058). Nelson Parker. Kindle
      Edition.]


      *Morning Star is a collection of naturally dynamic hierarchies. There isn’t one formal hierarchy; there are many informal ones. On any issue some colleagues will have a bigger say than others will, depending on their expertise and willingness to help. These are hierarchies of influence, not position, and they’re built from the bottom up. At Morning Star one accumulates authority by demonstrating expertise, helping peers, and adding value. Stop doing those things, and your influence wanes— as will your pay.*^\[Gary Hamel, “First, Let’s Fire All the Managers,” Harvard Business Review, December 2011, http:// hbr.org/ 2011/ 12/ first-lets-fire-all-the-managers, accessed April 11, 2012.]
