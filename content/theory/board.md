intro: "This section reviews the role of the board as well as some of the
  practices and ways of working as a board under Teal.\r

  \r\n"
perspective: "The composition of the board in a Teal organization is crucial,
  says Frederic Laloux. He warns that, when adopting a Teal approach, “The only
  make-or-break factors are the worldview held by the top leadership and by the
  owners/board of the organization.”^[Laloux, Frederic. Reinventing
  Organizations. Nelson Parker (2014), page 238]

  \r

  Why is this so? Because history shows that boards may well support Teal
  practices when things are going well. But, under pressure, the support of
  outsiders—who typically make up the board and may not have worked in a similar
  environment before—can evaporate quickly, and under our current legal
  structure, boards continue to have ultimate authority."

  ### The board needs to adopt Teal thinking


  This means: 


  * Forgoing the command and control privileges of earlier perspectives

  * Joining staff members in ‘listening’ for the organization's evolutionary purpose, and being willing to follow its direction.

  * Embracing the purpose and values of the organization.

  * “Holding the space” or doing whatever possible to support the organization’s practice of a Teal approach. 


  #### The board should also adopt Teal practices

    In self-managing organizations, the board is part of the "advice process". For example, if a board member believes a decision is needed, she should seek advice from appropriate people throughout the organization. In so doing, she not only shows support for the practice, but also invites others to seek advice from the board. This means the division between the board and the rest of the company becomes more ‘porous’, reducing the need for "go-betweens".

  #### The potential for conflict


  As mentioned earlier, there is potential for conflict when board members do not have a deeply held Teal worldview, since a board generally has ultimate legal authority. Even for board members with a Teal worldview, there is potential for problems in for-profit organizations. This is because board members there have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, and there is at least the potential that Teal practices may not always be viewed as serving those fiduciary duties.


  For–profit Teal organizations can pursue a couple of avenues to limit this potential for conflict. First, they can work to transition (with appropriate shareholder consent) the company to a “Benefit Corporation” structure. This structure, adopted in many states in the U.S., extends the duty of directors to include non-financial interests such as social benefit, concerns of employees and suppliers and environmental impact.


  Second, Holacracy has drafted a constitution that a board can adopt and make binding, even to future shareholders. It gives shareholders a legitimate say in matters related to finance, but prevents them from unilaterally imposing a strategy, or from reverting the organization to traditional management practices.


  Ultimately, the board is a construct of prior organizational stages, and it is as yet unclear exactly what its role should be under Teal or even if in its current form it is fully compatible with Teal.
faq:
  - question: If the organization is self-managing, why have a board?
    answer: >-
      1. A board might be a legal requirement, but more importantly it can act
      as a "spaceholder" and protector of Teal practices. This obviously
      necessitates that board members share the fundamental assumptions and the
      values underpinning Teal.

      1. It can add perspective, diversity and expertise on important decisions via the advice process.

      1. It can facilitate the process of appointing a new "CEO", should the organization have a continuing need for such a role, when a transition is due.


      Having said this, at Morningstar, Chris Rufer, founder and 100% owner, sees no need for a board. People at Morningstar regard the company’s mission/purpose as their ultimate boss.
  - question: Who will decide whether the CEO needs to go?
    answer: "The conflict resolution process deals with this and can be started by
      anyone who feels that a role-holder (including that of CEO) should be
      changed. Note that In a Teal company, the \"CEO\" role may be different.
      The \"CEO\" is an employee with the same rights and duties as anybody
      else.\r

      \r

      At Favi, when Zobrist became CEO, he promised his position would be
      submitted to a vote every 5 years.\r

      \r

      At Buurtzorg, the board does not appoint the CEO. This comes from
      within the organization itself."
  - question: Who should be part of the board?
    answer: >-
      Suitable people who:


      * Understand the core purpose of the organization; 


      * Are committed to its endeavours;


      * Share its guiding beliefs;


      * Can help connect the organization and develop relationships with its external environment.
