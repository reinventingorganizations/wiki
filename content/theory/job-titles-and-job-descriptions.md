intro: 职称与工作描述的主题包括，如何定义岗位角色和职责、由谁定义、如何演变、如何组织内得到正式认可的流程。
perspective: >-
  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)中，工作不是由组织来定义，而是由成员自己来定义：工作在许多能反映组织的利益、才能和需求的角色与责任中自然产生。通过专注于需要发生的事情而不是定义好的工作，蔚蓝组织往往更具适应性和响应能力，提高了作为一个仿生系统运作的能力。

  组织在每一个历史阶段都产生了对职称和工作描述的不同看法，以及截然不同的做法：


  #### **红色组织**


  [红色组织](../red-organizations/)的本质特征是在人际关系中不断行使权力。总的来说，没有正式的结构化层次构架，尽管可能有明确的角色划分，但没有职称头衔或正式的工作描述。酋长必须表现出压倒性的权力，并让其他人为保住位置而屈从于他的意志。酋长为了创造相对稳定的状态，一般让家人（往往更忠诚）环绕在自己周围，并通过分享战利品来换取他们的忠诚。每一个亲信成员也会各自照顾自己的部下，并保证他们服从。


  #### **琥珀组织**


  [琥珀组织](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/)通过正式的头衔、明确的层次结构和组织结构图来稳定权力。整体结构是一个“金字塔”，从高层管理者或领导者到下属，都有一系列的正式上下级指挥关系。有明确的规则来规定谁可以做什么。职位描述和头衔由高级领导设定，以便在整个组织内保持统一性。当代的许多学校、教会和公务员都是这样运作的，都设有标准化的职位描述和工资等级。这种方法的优势在于，让组织能够比较有效的实现其目标。并在此过程中，为雇员提供稳定性和确定性。


  #### **橙色组织**


  [橙色组织](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/)也有组织结构图，明确的职称和工作描述。精英制的价值在于有能力的任何个人都有晋升机会。不鼓励人们“认准自己的位置”并甘心固定在某个预定的岗位。每个职位都会有一个工作描述和职称，以反映成员在组织中的地位。工作描述的定义过程更加灵活，重点可能放在最终结果而不是职责上。职称在这些组织中很重要，因为它描述了工作人员的职责范围和地位。


  #### **绿色组织**


  [绿色组织](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/)也遵循等级制度，但更倾向于注重角色而不是工作本身。职责范围通过组织结构图确定。决策权被推到了一线成员身上，他们往往可以在没有管理层批准的情况下做出重大决策。工作和岗位角色可能更加通用和多变，在如何执行方面留有一定的自由度。职称不那么重要，成员通常被称为公民或家人员。工作描述会涉及到外部和内部利益相关者，强调关系管理的重要性。人力资源团队起关键作用，负责描述工作并令其符合组织的价值观和目标。


  #### **蔚蓝组织**


  在[蔚蓝组织](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)通常没有职称或工作职位描述。即使有工作描述，也往往很简短，只是用来描述对团队和/或彼此的一系列责任承诺。在一些蔚蓝组织中，职称是用来表示角色和职能的，而在另一些中则根本没有头衔或职称。人们通常可以根据工作量和个人偏好自主选择切换和交换角色。

  #### **Granular roles vs. defined jobs**


  In Teal organizations most people no longer have a single “job” that fits a generic description; instead, they fill a unique combination of roles.


  Job titles and descriptions rarely do justice to unique combinations of roles, and they are also too static to account for the fluid nature of work in Teal organizations. Colleagues frequently switch and trade roles according to workload and preferences.


  Thinking in terms of granular roles instead of predefined jobs creates great fluidity and adaptability. People can give up one role and take up another without needing to go through the cumbersome and often political processes of appointment, promotion, and salary negotiation.


  #### **Identity & Fit**


  Without a job title, it becomes that much harder for people to merge their identity with the position they hold. This fusion is commonplace today. When we believe our job is who we really are, we start thinking and behaving accordingly. Without job titles and job descriptions, we are more likely to see ourselves and others as human beings who simply put their energy into specific work for a period of time.


  Anotherkey benefit of this approach is that people tend to choose (and be appointed to) roles that have a much better fit with their interests and talents. When people can’t turn to a job description to tell them what to do, they have to find their own unique way to fill a role with life and meaning.


  #### **Scope and naming of roles**


  Not everyone is equal and all the jobs are not the same. Some roles have a rather narrow scope (say, the role of operating a certain machine or cleaning the office), while other roles take a broader perspective (for instance, the role of designing a new product line). The fluid arrangement of roles (instead of defined job descriptions) also allows for a better matching of talent with roles.


  In [Teal organizations](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) there is usually one person recognized for taking the broadest perspective, and usually they are called the CEO, at least by the outside world (even though they don't hold the same responsibilities and power as a traditional CEO). Some well-defined roles can be named,. but for the vast majority of employees, people don’t bother trying to find a label to capture the different roles they hold at any one point in time. In many  The language of employee or staff is often dropped entirely and in some cases replaced with the word, "colleague".


  #### **Management tasks within roles**


  The traditional tasks of a manager - direction-setting, budgeting, analyzing, planning, organizing, measuring, controlling, recruiting, evaluating, and communicating - are distributed amongst various members of a team. People are not accountable to one manager but to their peers, every one of whom is a boss in some respect. Anybody can put on the hat of “the boss” to make important decisions, launch new initiatives, hold underperforming colleagues to account, help resolve conflicts, or take over leadership if results are bad and action is needed. Many Teal organizations have noticed that “management’ creeps back in if too many leadership tasks are taken on by any one individual. For this reason people typically have the freedom to change teams and attention is paid to how work is distributed. The flip side is that people are no longer forced to take on management roles that might not fit their talents in order to advance their careers.


  One of the difficulties, for those used to an Orange or Green organization, is that it is much harder to know where you fit. The absence of grades and job titles makes career development and salary progression much less certain. People in Teal organizations are generally much more comfortable managing their own progression.


  #### **Knowing who is responsible for what**


  Outsiders, and sometimes even insiders, can find the absence of job descriptions and job titles confusing because it is less clear who is responsible for what.. For this reason some organizations keep a log on their intranet allowing people to  record the roles they are currently filling. This aids clarity and helps others understand their expertise.
faq:
  - question: Is there less management within an organization without job titles and
      job descriptions?
    answer: The tasks of management - setting direction and objectives, planning,
      directing, controlling, and evaluating - haven’t disappeared. They are
      simply no longer concentrated in dedicated management roles. Because they
      are spread widely, not narrowly, it can be argued that there is more
      management and leadership happening at any time in self-managing
      organizations despite, or rather precisely because of, the absence of
      fulltime managers.
