  Dieser Artikel befasst sich mit der Frage, wie Organisationen einen Raum
  schaffen können, der die nötige Sicherheit bietet, damit die Mitarbeiter das
  Gefühl haben, dass sie sich bei der Arbeit voll entfalten können.

perspective: >-
  [Teal-Organisationen (../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/) zielen darauf ab,
  einen sicheren Raum zu schaffen, der es den Kolleginnen und Kollegen erlaubt,
  sich mit all dem zu zeigen, was sie sind, mit ihrem männlichen und ihrem
  weiblichen Selbst, ihrem rationalen, emotionalen, intuitiven und spirituellen
  Selbst, ihren Stärken und ihrer Verletzlichkeit, ihren tieferen Hoffnungen und
  Sehnsüchten.  


  ### Rote Organisationen


  In [roten Organisationen](../red-organizations/), findet man eine gewisse Sicherheit in der vom Chef auferlegten Ordnung. Wenn man sich loyal verhält und die Wünsche und Befehle des Chefs befolgt, was auch immer sie sein mögen, ist man sicher. Wer sich dagegen dem Chef widersetzt, den erwartet eine harte Strafe.   


  ### Bernstein-Organisationen


  In [bernsteinfarbenen Organisationen](../amber-paradigm-and-organizations/) entsteht Sicherheit durch das Befolgen etablierter Regeln und Prozesse (die viel stabiler sind als die wechselnden Launen der roten Chefs). In bernsteinfarbenen Organisationen geht man davon aus, dass die Beschäftigung lebenslang ist, und ein Großteil des sozialen Lebens der Menschen dreht sich um die Organisation. Bestrafung bedeutet nicht mehr physische Gewalt, sondern kann Gehaltskürzungen, eine Verringerung des Ranges und der Privilegien sowie Entlassung zur Folge haben. Die Entlassung ist daher mit einer doppelten Bedrohung verbunden: dem Verlust der eigenen Identität und dem Ausschluss aus dem sozialen Gefüge, in das man eingebettet ist. Der Austritt aus einer bernsteinfarbenen Organisation ist oft ein schmerzhafter und beängstigender Prozess, ähnlich wie wenn man ein altes, bekanntes und sicheres Leben ablegt und ein neues Leben beginnen muss. (Kurz gesagt: Sicherheit vor Gewalt).

  ### Orange Organisationen


  In [orangenen Organisationen](../orange-paradigm-and-organizations/) entsteht die Sicherheit durch das Erreichen der erwarteten Ergebnisse. Die eigene Identität ist nicht mehr an ein bestimmtes Unternehmen gebunden, sondern im weiteren Sinne an die eigene berufliche Entwicklung. Scheitern und Entlassung sind ein Schlag für das Selbstwertgefühl, aber nicht mehr der Ausschluss aus dem sozialen Gefüge, in das man eingebettet ist. Man zieht einfach weiter und sucht sich eine Arbeit in einem anderen Unternehmen. (Kurzum: Sicherheit vor sozialer Ausgrenzung).


  ### Green organizations


  In [Green organizations](../green-paradigm-and-organizations/), safety comes from a set of shared values and the knowing that one is considered as a person, not just a "human resource". When an individual or the organization hits a rough patch, employees trust that colleagues will rally to offer support. (In short: emotional safety).


  ### Teal organizations


  [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)aim to establish a safe space where the ego can relax its defenses, allowing people to show up fully; their masculine & feminine selves, their rational, emotional, intuitive and spiritual selves and their strengths and vulnerability. (In short: safety of the soul)

  ### The importance of safe space


  In most organizations—just like in most group settings outside of work—it can feel risky to show up whole. Almost everyone has learned in childhood that when we expose who we really are, the parts of ourselves we cherish most, we feel vulnerable with: we open ourselves to possible mockery and ridicule, or to have what we shared used against us. Much better, then, is to play it safe, to hide behind a professional mask, to show up in ways we know are accepted and expected in the work place.


  That safety comes at a cost: We cut ourselves from the richness of our humanity. In the workplace, the mask we feel we need to wear is often mental, rational, masculine, self-centered. We cut ourselves off from our emotions, our intuitions, our body, our feminine side. We don’t heed our inner voice, our longings, our calling, our soul. We neglect our capacity for connection and compassion, for love for ourselves, for others, and for all life that surrounds us. We might feel safe. But the cost is a life that often feels empty and strangely lifeless..


  [Teal organizations ](../teal-paradigm-and-organizations/)have come to the realization that when employees leave so much of who they are behind, they also leave a great amount of their passion, creativity and energy behind. They are mindful to create a setting of safety—a safe space—where employees feel they can safely show up in [wholeness](../wholeness/). 


  ### Establishing ground rules


  Creating safe workplaces starts with raising everybody’s awareness of the mindsets, words and actions that create or encourage a safe working environment. Some organizations find it is important to write a document that spells out detailed ground rules for how people interact within the organization. Such a document speaks of the kind of words and actions that are encouraged, and the kind of words and actions that are considered unacceptable, as well as the underlying assumptions and mindsets. One can view such detailed ground rules as taking the shared values that many organizations define, to the next level: if these are our values, what kind of behaviors do we want to encourage and which declare unacceptable?


  Historically, many spiritual and wisdom traditions have elaborated rich traditions to create safe space—places that overcome fear and separation and invite into non-judgment and wholeness. Many contemporary thinkers have adapted or reinvented  similar principles and practices to create safe space within organizational realms, for instance in the space of organizational facilitation. Teal organizations often spend significant time training everyone in their ground rules, for example as part of a new colleague's [onboarding](../onboarding/), so that the ground holds are, as much as possible, upheld by everyone, without the need of a facilitator to enforce them.


  Typical ground rules include


  * *Speaking from "I":* rather than making interpretations and judging another person's actions or motivation, we try and put into words our own reactions, emotions, needs and requests.  

  * *No fixing, advising, saving or correcting others:* when others feel we have an intention to change them, they are likely to feel intruded upon and to feel the space is no longer safe for them to show up as they are.  

  * *Accepting emotions*: many cultures especially in most organizations today are generally ill at ease with "negative" emotions such as anger, sadness or frustration (and sometimes even of "positive" emotions such as joy or empathy). When someone shares such an emotion, we are often quick to try and get the person to "get over" their emotion, thereby giving the message that someone's emotion is not welcome. 

  * *Accepting conflict*: these cultures are also generally ill at ease with conflicts, that get quickly passed over. And yet, conflict is a natural consequence of the fact that as human beings, we all have different needs and perspectives. Having a well defined [conflict resolution process](../conflict-resolution/) in place is helpful, as well as clear guidelines to help deal with conflict gracefully. 

  * *Avoiding demeaning speech and behaviors*: To feel safe, we need to feel that we are accepted as equals in value. Any form of -ism (sexism, racism, etc.) as well as any form, however subtle, that establishes that one person is superior to another (snide remark, rolling of the eyes, and so forth) will make us feel unsafe and trigger our ego defenses. 

  * *Questioning one's perspective:* A safe space is one where we can explore our feelings and thoughts without fear of judgment. That exploration is made difficult, if someone else believes they are right, and that by contrast, everyone with a different question must be wrong. We must enter every discussion with a willingness to see things from different perspectives, to question our own perspective and assumption..  


  ### Recurring moments to reaffirm ground rules


  Unfortunately, we don't learn about how to create a safe space in school. Commonly writing a document with the ground rules for a safe space might be a helpful way for colleagues in the organization to steep themselves in this thinking. They can be used as a powerful training program during new colleagues' [onboarding process](../onboarding/). Many organizations find that this is not enough, though, for everyone to deeply integrate these ground rules in their mindsets and behaviors. It is useful to foresee recurring moments where the ground rules are reaffirmed, role modeled and explicitly enforced by a colleague taking on a facilitator's role. These recurring moments can include:


  * Important, recurring meetings (for instance quarterly all-hands meetings) 

  * Large group processes to [listen to an organizations' purpose](../listening-to-purpose/) (for instance using methodologies such as Theory U, Appreciative Inquiry, or Open Space) 

  * Any meetings that promises to be difficult or touchy, where the presence of a facilitator might be helpful 

  * An annual "values day" 

  * Any training program or workshop.
faq:
  - question: How can ground rules for a safe space be established? What is the role
      of the founder or "CEO" in the process?
    answer: "As a founder or leader of the organization, you might be the main (or
      perhaps even only) person to sense that creating safe space is critical.
      Can you \"impose\" the creating of safe space? How could you involve
      others in writing down a set of ground rules, if you are the only one that
      sees the need? \r

      \r

      The best way to establish a set of ground rules is to involve as
      many people as possible in the organization. How can that be done? Being
      in a space where we feel truly safe is a liberating feeling, but that
      unfortunately, many people (and therefore many of your colleagues) might
      never have experienced in the workplace. And yet, it is something we all
      long for, and that in some small way we have all experienced at some
      point. Large group processes, such as Appreciative Inquiry, for instance,
      can be great catalysts to bring people to reflect on and acknowledge the
      importance of feeling safe, and to collectively develop a set of ground
      rules. \r

      \r

      Using the Appreciative Inquiry framework as an example (but other
      large group processes could be used too), you could invite the entire
      organization (small or large, or subsections of the organization):\r

      \r

      * to inquire, in a deep reflection in paired interviews, into
      moments (for instance in a conversation with a friend of family member)
      where they have felt safe enough to show up whole. What did it feel like?
      What were the necessary conditions?\r

      * participants then share some of the stories and insights into a
      broader circle (which itself is one that role models safe space), and
      commonly establish some of the necessary conditions that were present.\r

      * from those necessary conditions, participants to self-organize
      into groups that craft a document which establishes the ground rules\r

      * as a last step, participants to jointly define the recurring
      moments during the year where the ground rules will be affirmed and
      role-modeled by a facilitator. \r


      The role you can play as founder or CEO is to be the initiator and
      convener, possibly the one choosing an external facilitator that might
      hold the space for the process of Appreciative Inquiry or the methodology
      you'll have chosen. In the invitation to the group, you can speak
      powerfully to why you believe this is important. Once in the group
      process, you can relax and become one voice among the many contributing to
      establish the ground rules. "
